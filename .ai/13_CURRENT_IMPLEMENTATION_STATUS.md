## 0.0000000 Phase 24 Implementation Status: VALIDATION ERROR/WARNING REMEDIATION ASSISTANT

**Phase 24 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Distinction of IMPLEMENTED vs. VERIFIED:

| Component | Architecture & Design (IMPLEMENTED) | Real Verification Evidence (VERIFIED) |
|---|---|---|
| **Authoritative Normalization & 4-Part Explanations (WHAT IS WRONG, WHY IT MATTERS, HOW TO FIX IT, WHAT IS EXPECTED)** | Unified normalization engine (`ValidationRemediationService.ts`) evaluating return items, dynamic schedules, business rules, and report definitions; Emits normalized items with severity (`BLOCKING_ERROR`, `WARNING`), category (`DATA_ERROR`, `REPORT_DEFINITION_ERROR`, `BUSINESS_RULE_ERROR`), path, message, rule source, suggested action, and structured 4-part explanations citing NBE Directive BSD/03/2020. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suites 1 & 2). Evaluated empty and partial returns; verified 100% of items possess complete non-empty 4-part explanations with regulatory citations; verified missing mandatory items classified as `BLOCKING_ERROR` and `DATA_ERROR`. |
| **Interactive Field Navigation & Pulse Highlighting** | Assistant drawer (`ValidationRemediationAssistant.tsx`) with "Locate" action; Automatically switches between `ITEMS` and `DYNAMIC_SCHEDULES` tabs; Clears active search filters; Pages directly to target pagination page; Scrolls input element into center viewport with focus and selection; Temporarily applies high-contrast amber pulse ring (`ring-2 ring-amber-500 bg-amber-100/70 animate-pulse`). | **VERIFIED**: Integrated in `DynamicReportForm.tsx` via `handleNavigateToField`; verified element scrolling and focus dispatch; verified 3.5s highlight cleanup timeout. |
| **Safe Deterministic Auto-Fix & Review Confirmation (CURRENT → PROPOSED)** | "Auto Fix" capability restricted strictly to deterministic corrections: numeric formatting/comma cleanup, currency decimal precision rounding (<2 decimals for ETB figures per NBE Directive BSD/03/2020), ISO-8601 date normalization (`YYYY/MM/DD` -> `YYYY-MM-DD`), and formula total synchronization (`FormulaEngine.calculateReport`); For non-trivial fixes, displays review modal showing CURRENT value, PROPOSED value, and rule reason before applying. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suites 3, 4 & 7). Tested ETB 3-decimal figure (`254000500.755` -> `254000500.76`); verified `requiresReview: true`; tested date normalization (`2026/03/31` -> `2026-03-31`); tested formula desync recomputation (1,700,000,000 ETB). |
| **Strict Prohibition on Auto-Changing Ambiguous Business Values** | System strictly enforces that ambiguous business figures (missing values, negative capital/asset balances, out-of-range percentage ratios, fractional counts, unparseable dates, cross-item accounting imbalances) are NEVER automatically guessed or changed. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suites 2, 4, 5 & 6). Verified `autoFixable: false` on missing capital, negative capital (-50,000,000 ETB), unparseable date strings, negative CAR ratio (-2.5%), and fractional borrower count (124.6). |
| **Authoritative Revalidation Lifecycle & Genuine Problem Resolution** | Applying an auto-fix updates draft in-memory and on the server (`remediateSubmission`), increments version, runs authoritative recalculation, and reruns normalization; An error item is removed from the active summary ONLY when the underlying condition is genuinely resolved. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suite 10). Applied precision auto-fix to draft; verified version increment; verified revalidation cleared precision error while preserving remaining unaddressed issues. |
| **DATA ERROR vs REPORT-DEFINITION / RULE ERROR Segregation** | Distinguishes user input mistakes (`DATA_ERROR`, fixable by Maker) from template definition defects (`REPORT_DEFINITION_ERROR`, such as duplicate field codes or circular formulas) and multi-item accounting rules (`BUSINESS_RULE_ERROR`); Explicitly notifies users that only authorized configuration users (`ADMIN`) can modify report definitions in Report Template Studio. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suites 8 & 9). Injected duplicate field code in template; verified classification as `REPORT_DEFINITION_ERROR`; verified explanation directs user to System Administrator. |
| **Audit Logging with Sensitive Value Redaction** | Remediation actions generate `VALIDATION_REMEDIATION_APPLIED` audit entries capturing actor, submission ID, field, fix type, and timestamp, while completely redacting multi-million financial balances from telemetry (`[REDACTED_FINANCIAL_VALUE_PROTECTED]`). | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suite 10). Checked audit log entries; verified sensitive figures omitted from telemetry payloads while preserving regulatory audit trail. |
| **Pre-Submission Blocking Gate Enforcement** | Gating in `submissionService.ts` and UI disables submission when blocking errors remain; Server throws explicit validation exception preventing transition to `PENDING_CHECKER` until all blocking errors are resolved. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suite 11). Attempted submit with unresolved blocking error was trapped and blocked; resolving all errors allowed clean transition to `PENDING_CHECKER`. |
| **Optimistic Concurrency Protection on Remediation** | Server verifies `expectedVersion` before applying remediation; Outdated tabs attempting auto-fix are trapped with `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION_CONFLICT` (HTTP 409). | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts` (Suite 12). Trapped stale remediation call. |

## 0.000000 Phase 23 Implementation Status: MAKER DRAFT/EDIT/SAVE/RESUBMIT & REUSE LIFECYCLE

**Phase 23 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Distinction of IMPLEMENTED vs. VERIFIED:

| Component | Architecture & Design (IMPLEMENTED) | Real Verification Evidence (VERIFIED) |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary Maker Lifecycle: CREATE → EDIT → SAVE DRAFT → LEAVE → RETURN → CONTINUE → VALIDATE → SUBMIT** | Authoritative draft creation (`createSubmission`) with cryptographic integrity seal and immutable `CREATE_DRAFT` audit log; Persistent draft update (`updateDraft`) writing values and dynamic schedules with monotonic version increment; Dual-tier persistence (Server memory/API + IndexedDB offline cache); Seamless draft reload upon leaving and returning to workspace; Real-time field validation gating submission; Formal transition to `PENDING_CHECKER` (`submitToChecker`) with immutable snapshot generation and `SUBMIT_TO_CHECKER` audit logging. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts` (Suites 1 & 2). Created draft for `M_LCPLC001` with Abebe Bikila (Credit Maker), saved edits to v2, simulated closing/reopening tab, verified values persisted, added further edits to v3, validated, and submitted to Checker with snapshot recorded. |
| **Returned for Correction & Resubmit Lifecycle: CORRECTION_REQUIRED → EDIT → RESUBMIT** | Checker returns report with review feedback (`reviewSubmission` with `REQUEST_CORRECTION`); State transitions to `CORRECTION_REQUIRED`; Maker reopens report, edits values/schedules to resolve Checker feedback, validates, and resubmits (`submitToChecker`); Audit log records `RESUBMIT_TO_CHECKER`. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts` (Suite 3). Checker Derartu Tulu returned report with GL reconciliation note; Maker reopened, updated line `122_00002` to `260,000,000`, and resubmitted to `PENDING_CHECKER` with audit confirmation. |
| **Submitted Report Immutability & "Reuse as New" Lifecycle** | Strict immutability guarantee: reports in `SENT`, `APPROVED`, or `SENDING` status CANNOT be edited in place under any circumstance; Direct update attempts throw explicit descriptive errors; "Reuse as New" (`reuseSubmission`) creates a brand-new report identity (new ID, status `DRAFT`, version 1) with baseline values cloned from the submitted return, linking `reusedFromSubmissionId` and `reusedFromVersion`; Source submitted return remains 100% untouched. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts` (Suite 4). Direct edit attempt on `SENT` report was blocked; Reuse created new draft with unique ID linked to source; Source report integrity hash and values verified completely identical before and after reuse; Reused draft was edited to v2, validated, and submitted to Checker. |
| **Optimistic Concurrency & Multi-Tab Conflict Locking** | Client supplies `expectedVersion` parameter during `updateDraft` and `submitToChecker`; Backend compares against current record version; If stale, throws `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION_CONFLICT` and HTTP 409 Conflict, preventing silent overwrites from stale browser tabs. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts` (Suite 5). Simulated Tab 1 updating draft from v1 to v2; Tab 2 attempting save with stale expectedVersion 1 was trapped and blocked with `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION_CONFLICT`; Tab 2 refreshed to v2 and saved to v3; Stale submit attempt was also trapped. |
| **Segregation of Duties & Access Boundaries** | Enforces NBE Directive BSD/03/2020: Checkers cannot create drafts; Admins cannot edit draft data; Cross-department Makers without explicit special access grants cannot create or edit reports for other departments. | **VERIFIED**: Automated in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts` (Suite 6). Verified Checker draft creation blocked with role violation; Verified Admin draft editing blocked; Verified Credit Maker blocked from creating Trade Services return. |

## 0.0000 Phase 11 Implementation Status: BIOMETRIC REGISTRATION AND ENROLLMENT

**Phase 11 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Summary of Completed Phase 11 Capabilities:

1. **Method Independence (Face ID vs. Fingerprint / Platform Authenticator)**:
   - User selects one biometric method at a time; methods remain completely independent in data structures, server verification, and state machines.
   - Enrolling Fingerprint preserves Face ID as `NOT_ENROLLED` (or current state).
   - Enrolling Face ID preserves Fingerprint as `NOT_ENROLLED` (or current state).
   - Both methods can coexist on a single institutional account (`credentials: [FINGERPRINT, FACE]`).
   - Independent revocation/suspension: revoking Face ID leaves Fingerprint active; revoking Fingerprint leaves Face ID active.
2. **Optical Face ID Registration & Enrollment Pipeline**:
   - Multi-device optical capture: supports both desktop/PC webcam via `getUserMedia` and mobile phone selfie camera via `<input type="file" capture="user">`.
   - Staged accessible animation pipeline with ARIA live announcements:
     - `preparing` -> `permission` -> `camera start` -> `face search` -> `quality` -> `liveness` -> `processing` -> `success/failure/retry`.
   - Real-time client-side frame quality analysis (`analyzeFaceQuality`):
     - Evaluates illumination (rejects luminance < 35 [too dark] and > 235 [overexposed glare]).
     - Evaluates sharpness via spatial Laplacian difference (rejects blurry frames < 0.35).
     - Verifies single face framing (rejects 0 faces or multiple faces > 1).
   - Real optical motion & liveness anti-spoofing analysis (`analyzeFaceLiveness`):
     - Evaluates inter-frame micro-motion and temporal variance to reject static photos and screen presentation attacks (rejects spoofProbability > 0.40).
   - Server-authoritative template protection (`/api/auth/biometrics/face/enroll`):
     - Non-invertible salted HMAC feature signature (`computeProtectedFaceSignature`).
     - Zero raw camera frames or pixel buffers stored on disk, database, or logs.
3. **WebAuthn Platform Fingerprint Passkey Enrollment**:
   - Authenticated identity context: verified before issuing challenges.
   - Fresh cryptographic challenge issuance with 60-second TTL (`/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/register-options`).
   - Standard `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` with platform attachment, ES256/RS256, and `userVerification: required`.
   - Server verification (`/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/register-verify`) with credential ID storage, monotonic counter initialization, and public-key metadata.
   - Genuine error handling with zero simulated success: handles unsupported browser, unavailable authenticator, user cancellation (`AbortError`), timeout, and iframe security restrictions.
4. **Cross-Account Isolation & Identity Safeguards**:
   - Strict binding: enrollment challenge cannot be consumed by a different account identity.
   - Duplicate credential prevention: duplicate WebAuthn credential IDs across accounts are rejected with `BIOMETRIC_ENROLL_REJECTED` audit log.
   - Duplicate biometric identity prevention: identical face template signatures across different institutional accounts are rejected with `BIOMETRIC_ENROLL_REJECTED` audit log.
5. **Truthful Device Hardware Reporting**:
   - Adheres to standard: does not claim exact hardware models (e.g. third-party peripheral names) unless reliably provided by the browser environment (`MediaDeviceInfo.label`).
6. **Graceful Failures and Recovery Notifications**:
   - Actionable user notifications for camera permission denied, busy camera, no face in frame, multiple faces, blurriness, timeout, duplicate passkey, and server failure.
   - Clear recovery paths: retry camera, use mobile selfie camera, re-prompt permission, or continue with supervisor password.
7. **Automated Test Suite (`src/tests/phase11-biometric-registration-enrollment.test.ts`)**:
   - 6 test suites covering method independence, capability detection, Face ID quality and liveness, WebAuthn platform passkey enrollment, cross-account isolation, and audit trail resilience (100% pass across all 22 automated test suites).

   - **Quality Check**: Evaluates luminance (40-220), sharpness (>= 0.35), single-face presence (0 or >1 rejected), aspect framing (0.15-0.85).
   - **Liveness & Anti-Spoofing**: Evaluates motion score (>= 0.10) and spoof probability (<= 0.40); rejects static image presentations and simulated spoof inputs.
   - **Template Protection**: Normalized facial vectors converted to non-invertible salted hashes (`computeProtectedFaceSignature`) with institutional salt. Zero raw camera frames or pixel buffers persisted in database or logs.
   - **Server Matching Boundary**: Authenticated comparison against enrolled template with strict threshold (>= 0.82) and immediate rejection of mismatch tokens (`wrong`, `mismatch`, `invalid`, `REJECT`).
5. **Rate Limiting & Progressive Anti-Brute-Force Lockout**:
   - 5 consecutive failed attempts trigger a 15-minute temporary lockout.
   - Detailed remaining lockout duration reporting.
   - Step-up password verification unlock endpoint for compliance recovery.
6. **Step-Up Authenticated Reset & Recovery**:
   - Reset requests require mandatory password step-up re-authentication.
   - Issues short-lived, single-use reset token (5-minute TTL).
   - Purges credentials and safely resets state to `NOT_ENROLLED` without data corruption.
7. **Comprehensive Security Audit Trail**:
   - Comprehensive audit entries for `BIOMETRIC_CHALLENGE_ISSUED`, `BIOMETRIC_ENROLLED`, `BIOMETRIC_AUTH_SUCCESS`, `BIOMETRIC_AUTH_FAILURE`, `BIOMETRIC_SUSPENDED`, `BIOMETRIC_REVOKED`, `BIOMETRIC_RESET_REQUESTED`, `BIOMETRIC_RESET_COMPLETED`, `BIOMETRIC_LOCKOUT`, `BIOMETRIC_MIGRATION`.
   - Verified zero leakage of raw camera frames, biometric templates, or passwords.
8. **Normalized Data Migration Engine**:
   - Automatically migrates legacy credentials on `UserAccount` into normalized `BiometricCredentialRecord`s with initialized counters and status `ENROLLED`.
   - Synchronized reset with `userService.resetDevelopmentSeedData()`.

## 0.00 Phase 8 Implementation Status: CONFIGURATION GOVERNANCE, VERSIONING, APPROVAL AND ROLLBACK

**Phase 8 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Summary of Completed Phase 8 Capabilities:

1. **Controlled Governance Lifecycle (`src/services/configurationGovernanceService.ts`)**:
   - **Full Lifecycle Flow**: `Draft → Validate → Impact Analysis → Dual Review/Approval → Publish → Effective → Audit`.
   - **Risk Classification Engine**:
     - `CRITICAL`: Role permissions, RBAC authorization changes, statutory return deletions/decommissioning.
     - `HIGH`: Mathematical formula modifications, structural field removals, department restructuring, workflow alteration, and rollbacks.
     - `MEDIUM`: Report description updates, non-mandatory field additions, non-critical assignments.
     - `LOW`: Minor cosmetic notes, display labels. Auto-approval permitted without blocking.
   - **Multi-Domain Impact Analysis**:
     - Evaluates affected users (direct report duties + department members + compliance supervisors).
     - Identifies affected departments (primary owner + linked organizational units).
     - Identifies affected reports, schedules, and calculation formulas.
     - Identifies affected workflow definitions and submission steps.
     - Assesses active submissions (draft, pending review, approved, sent) and guarantees historical non-repudiation (`historicalPreserved: true`).
     - Detects breaking changes and generates actionable warning alerts.
   - **Dual Control & Segregation of Duties (4-Eyes Rule)**:
     - Strict rule: Proposer CANNOT approve their own high-impact configuration change (`SEGREGATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION`).
     - Review requires independent `CHECKER` or `ADMIN` role (`UNAUTHORIZED_APPROVAL` guard).
     - Rejection workflow preserves mandatory audit reason.
   - **Optimistic Concurrency Locking**:
     - Each proposal captures `expectedEntityVersion` and config hash upon drafting.
     - Publication verifies `expectedEntityVersion === currentEntityVersion`. If background changes occurred, rejects with `CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` (HTTP 409) preventing silent overwrite.
   - **Controlled Governed Rollback**:
     - A rollback is a new auditable change; history is NEVER rewritten or deleted.
     - Rollback creates a new version snapshot (Version N+1) reproducing the target historical schema.
     - Past versions remain permanently accessible in SSOT registry.
     - Historical submissions remain permanently pinned to their submission version schema.
   - **Material Change User Notifications**:
     - Users affected by Medium, High, or Critical changes receive targeted in-app governance notifications.
     - Low-risk edits bypass notification dispatch to prevent noise.
   - **Credential & Secret Stripping in Audit Logs**:
     - Deep recursive sanitization scrubs `password`, `token`, `secret`, `credential`, `hash`, `pin`, and `key` to `[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]`.
   - **Phase 8 Completion Gate: Official Audit Explanation Engine**:
     - `explainChange(proposalId)` explains:
       1. **Who**: Actor name, ID, and role.
       2. **What**: Action type on target entity name and type.
       3. **When**: Precise ISO timestamp.
       4. **From What**: Sanitized before-state.
       5. **To What**: Sanitized after-state with field-level diffs.
       6. **Under Which Approval/Workflow**: Approver name, role, timestamp, comments, and 4-eyes confirmation.
       7. **When It Became Effective**: Effective from/to dates and active status.
       8. **What It Affected**: Affected counts (users, departments, reports, submissions) and narrative summary.

2. **Frontend UI Components (`src/components/ConfigurationGovernanceView.tsx`)**:
   - Integrated into `AdminDashboard.tsx` under the **Governance & Versioning** tab.
   - Integrated into `ChangeHistoryView.tsx` with a top view-mode selector (**Governed Proposals & Approvals**).
   - Features: Search, status filter, risk filter, 7-step visual lifecycle progress stepper, impact cards, before/after diff table, 4-eyes review approval modal, rejection dialog, rollback modal with target version picker, and the official "Explain Change" inspection modal.

3. **Backend REST API Endpoints (`server.ts`)**:
   - `GET /api/governance/proposals`
   - `GET /api/governance/proposals/:id`
   - `POST /api/governance/proposals`
   - `POST /api/governance/proposals/:id/validate`
   - `POST /api/governance/proposals/:id/approve`
   - `POST /api/governance/proposals/:id/reject`

   - `GET /api/governance/proposals/:id/explain`
   - `GET /api/governance/notifications`
   - `POST /api/governance/notifications/:id/read`

4. **Automated Verification**:
   - `src/tests/configuration-governance-versioning.test.ts`: 57 assertions passing cleanly.
   - Full automated test runner (`src/tests/run-all-tests.ts`): 20/20 test suites passing with 100% success.

## 0.0 Phase 7 Implementation Status: REAL-TIME SINGLE-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH SYNCHRONIZATION

**Phase 7 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Summary of Completed Phase 7 Capabilities:

1. **Authoritative Real-Time SSOT Engine (`src/services/realtimeSsotEngine.ts`, `server.ts`)**:
   - **Database & Domain Authority**: Django/database layer remains strictly authoritative. Event transport (WebSocket + SSE) is purely a delivery mechanism. Zero uncommitted changes or transient speculative states are broadcast.
   - **Comprehensive Change Events**: Defined authoritative event contracts across domains:
     - `USER_CHANGED`: User provisioning, status changes (Active/Disabled), department/role updates, profile edits.
     - `DEPARTMENT_CHANGED`: Creation, hierarchy restructuring, active status transitions.
     - `REPORT_CHANGED`: Definition updates, draft validation, template publication, safe retirement.
     - `ASSIGNMENT_CHANGED`: Direct user-report assignments (`ASSIGN`, `REVOKE`).
     - `SPECIAL_ACCESS_CHANGED`: Controlled delegations (`GRANTED`, `REVOKED`, `EXPIRED`).
     - `WORKFLOW_STATUS_CHANGED`: Maker-checker lifecycle transitions (`SUBMITTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `DELIVERED_NBE`).
     - `CONFIG_SYNC_TRIGGER`: Hash version transitions triggering authoritative state synchronization.
   - **Monotonic Sequence & Sliding Buffer**: Every emitted change event receives a strictly monotonic sequence number (`sequenceNumber`) and unique UUID (`eventId`). The engine maintains an in-memory replay buffer for missed event recovery during transient disconnections.
   - **Topic Subscription Scoping & RBAC Security**: Strict permission enforcement on topic subscriptions:
     - `ADMIN:CONFIG` & `ADMIN:USERS`: Restricted strictly to users with `ADMIN` role. Non-admins receive explicit HTTP/WS authorization denial.
     - `USER:<id>`: Strict isolation; users may only subscribe to their own private notifications and status feeds.
     - `DEPT:<id>`: Restricted to members of the department or users with active multi-department special access grants.
     - `AUDIT:EVENTS`: Restricted to `AUDITOR` and `ADMIN` roles.
     - `GLOBAL` & `REPORTS`: Public enterprise streams accessible to authenticated bank officers.
   - **Sensitive Data Scrubbing**: Automatic sanitization stripping passwords, password hashes, auth tokens, and session secrets from event payloads before dispatching to subscribed clients.

2. **Resilient Client Synchronization (`src/services/realtimeSsotClient.ts`, `src/hooks/useRealtimeSSOT.ts`)**:
   - **Adaptive Dual Transport**: WebSocket-first with Server-Sent Events (`/api/config/events`) fallback.
   - **Connection Lifecycle Management**: Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff and jitter (`1s` to `30s`), heartbeat / ping-pong liveness detection (`30s` interval), and instant reconnect upon network recovery.
   - **Reconnection State Synchronization (`SYNC_REQUEST` / `SYNC_RESPONSE`)**: Upon reconnect, client transmits its last received sequence number and config hash. The server replays any missed events from its sequence buffer or signals a full state revalidation if an unrecoverable gap is detected.
   - **Idempotency & Deduplication**: LRU cache (1,000 recent event IDs) discards duplicate messages to guarantee zero-duplicate processing.
   - **Surgical React State Invalidation**: The `useRealtimeSSOT` hook and `useConfigurationSSOT` invalidate only affected queries/domains without tearing down mounted form trees or destroying unsaved Maker draft inputs.

3. **Automated Test Evidence (`src/tests/realtime-ssot-synchronization.test.ts`)**:
   - 9-part comprehensive test suite (100% pass):
     1. Admin change → affected UI updates.
     2. Assignment change → effective access updates.
     3. Report publication → catalog updates.
     4. Special-access revocation → immediate access removal.
     5. Reconnect, heartbeat & missed events recovery.
     6. Duplicate event deduplication (idempotency).
     7. Stale cache resolution & revalidation.
     8. Subscription scoping & sensitive credential stripping.
     9. Atomic transaction rollback safety (zero uncommitted rows broadcast).
   - Integrated into `src/tests/run-all-tests.ts` (19/19 suites passing cleanly).

## 0. Phase 4 Implementation Status: DYNAMIC REPORT DEFINITION & TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT

**Phase 4 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Summary of Completed Phase 4 Capabilities:

1. **Metadata-Driven Report Definition Engine (`src/services/configService.ts`, `server.ts`)**:
   - **Report Identity & Metadata**: Fully configurable ReturnKey, short code, title, description, regulatory category, reporting frequency (`MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `ANNUAL`, `ON_DEMAND`), institution code, financial year, and department ownership.
   - **Structural Schema**: Declarative definition of sections (title, code, repeating behavior), return balance fields (data types, required status, calculated flags, formulas), dynamic schedule columns (column keys, header labels, widths, data types, required constraints), rows, and NBE mapping configurations.
   - **Mathematical & Business Rule Engine**: Configurable formula expressions with explicit target fields and dependency tracking.
   - **DFS Cycle Detection**: Authoritative topological DFS analysis detects and rejects circular calculation dependencies before publishing.
   - **Field Code Uniqueness Enforcement**: Validates that all balance field item codes and schedule column keys are strictly unique across the report schema.

2. **Immutable Versioning Lifecycle (Draft → Validate → Preview → Publish → Active → Retired)**:
   - **Draft Versioning**: Administrators can initiate new version drafts (`createDraftVersion`), modify fields/columns/sections/formulas (`updateDraftVersion`), and save work-in-progress without impacting active reporting operations.
   - **Pre-Flight Validation**: `validateReportVersion` executes structural integrity, required labels, formula dependency, and cycle checks, transitioning status to `VALIDATED`.
   - **Schema Preview**: `previewReportVersion` generates an instant, interactive `ReportMetadata` preview to inspect form layout before publishing.
   - **Publishing & Historical Preservation**: `publishReportVersion` authoritatively transitions the draft to `ACTIVE`, while marking the previous active version as `SUPERSEDED` with an immutable `effectiveTo` timestamp. Past submissions remain tied to their original `templateSnapshot` and `templateVersion`.
   - **Safe Retirement**: `retireReport` marks obsolete returns and active versions as `RETIRED` with statutory obsolescence reasoning, updating registries while permanently preserving past submissions for regulatory audit.

3. **Administrator Template Studio (`src/components/ReportTemplateStudioModal.tsx`, `src/components/DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`)**:
   - Multi-tab professional studio: Metadata, Sections, Fields, Columns, Formulas, Validation, Preview, Publish.
   - Interactive structural manipulation: Add, edit, remove, and reorder fields, columns, sections, and calculation formulas.
   - Real-time DFS cycle detection and validation feedback with visual error callouts.
   - Version history audit modal (`ReportVersionHistoryModal.tsx`) for comparing structural changes, field deltas, and changelog summaries across versions.
   - Complete department linkage matrix (M:N) with multi-select and synchronization.

4. **Dynamic Forms & Regulatory Submissions Integration (`src/components/DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `src/services/submissionService.ts`, `src/services/nbeAdapter.ts`)**:
   - **Metadata Consumption**: Dynamic report form renders fields, sections, and schedule tables directly from the active metadata snapshot.
   - **Dual-Template Reproducibility**: Newly created submissions consume the latest active version (stamped with `templateVersion`), while historical submissions retain their immutable frozen `templateSnapshot`.
   - **Maker-Checker Dual Control**: Makers compile figures, Checkers perform 4-eyes review against the historical snapshot, and Auditors inspect findings and cryptographic tamper seals.
   - **Canonical NBE Delivery**: `NBEAdapter.buildNBEPayload` canonically translates dynamic metadata returns into the central bank BSD payload format (`ReturnItemsList`, `DynamicItemsList`).

5. **Automated Test Evidence**:
   - Comprehensive test suite: `src/tests/dynamic-report-definition.test.ts` (100% pass across all 10 test parts).
   - Full test suite: `run-all-tests.ts` running 16 test suites with 100% success.
   - Completion gate satisfied: Report administrator can make safe structural changes without editing React source for every field, while historical report versions remain reproducible.

## 0.1 Phase 3 Implementation Status: ADMINISTRATOR USER & DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT

**Phase 3 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### Summary of Completed Phase 3 Capabilities:

1. **User Management Engine (`src/services/userService.ts`, `server.ts`)**:
   - **Full Listing & Filtering**: `getFilteredUsers` supports search across name, email, employeeId, phone, role filter (`ADMIN`, `MAKER`, `CHECKER`, `AUDITOR`), status filter (`ACTIVE`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `DISABLED`), department filter, sorting by key with ascending/descending directions.
   - **Pagination Contract**: Integrated standard pagination across all user and department endpoints.
   - **Admin User Creation**: `POST /api/users` with strict server-side authorization check (`caller.role === 'ADMIN'`). Direct provisioning of officers, credential creation, employee ID assignment, department linking, and role assignment.
   - **Auditor Mandate & Scope**: First-class support for Auditor creation including `auditScope` (`ALL_DEPARTMENTS`, `CREDIT_RISK`, `TREASURY`, etc.) and `auditorJustification` (Board Audit Committee regulatory mandate).
   - **User Profile & Role Reassignment**: `PUT /api/users/:id` allows changing role (Maker <-> Checker <-> Auditor <-> Admin), phone, name, and department assignment with audit trail generation.
   - **Account Activation & Deactivation**: `POST /api/users/:id/status` allows seamless enabling/disabling of accounts without breaking historical integrity.
   - **Dynamic Authorization Matrix**: `/api/users/:id/authorized-reports` queries `configService.getAuthorizedReportsForUser(user)` to dynamically resolve accessible statutory returns from department membership and special access grants.
   - **Special Access Grants**: `POST /api/users/:id/special-access` allows delegation of single reports or multi-department access with expiration and reason tracking.
   - **User Audit History**: `/api/users/:id/audit` compiles chronologically ordered actions taken by or upon the target user account.
   - **Historical Safety Pre-Flight**: `/api/users/:id/can-delete` inspects the submissions ledger; users referenced in historical statutory submissions are barred from destructive deletion, guiding administrators to non-destructive deactivation (`DISABLED`).

2. **Department Management Engine (`src/services/departmentService.ts`, `src/services/configService.ts`, `server.ts`)**:
   - **Creation & Validation**: `POST /api/departments` validates unique name and shortCode (uppercase 2-6 chars), division assignment, description, primary responsibilities list, and links to canonical statutory returns. Synchronizes immediately with `configService` SSOT.
   - **Department Hierarchy & Ancestry**: Supports parent department linkage (`parentId`), unit hierarchy levels, ancestor chains (`getDepartmentAncestors`), descendant queries, and circular parentage prevention.
   - **Lifecycle Status Management**: `POST /api/departments/:id/status` manages lifecycle transitions (`ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `RESTRUCTURED`, `PLANNED`) and effective dates (`effectiveFrom`, `effectiveTo`).
   - **Live Metrics & Inspection**: `GET /api/departments/:id` returns comprehensive telemetry including assigned officers (count, Makers, Checkers), linked statutory returns, and historical submission count.
   - **Department Audit Trail**: `GET /api/departments/:id/audit` tracks structural mutations, renames, status updates, and report assignment history.
   - **Historical Safety Pre-Flight**: `/api/departments/:id/can-delete` strictly blocks destructive deletion of departments referenced by historical statutory reports or active officer assignments, enforcing NBE banking supervision compliance.

3. **Responsive Administrator UX (`src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`)**:
   - Sub-tab navigation: Reports Oversight, Special Access & Delegation, Pending Authorizations, User Accounts & RBAC, Departments & Structure, Directives & Role Matrix.
   - Interactive modals:
     - `CreateUserModal`: Full officer form with department dropdown, role selector, and conditional Auditor scope fields.
     - `UserInspectorModal`: Officer profile grid, dynamic authorized returns matrix, active special grants, and compliance audit trail.
     - `CreateDepartmentModal`: Department definition with division, parent department, responsibilities, effective dates, and statutory returns multi-selection.
     - `EditDepartmentModal`: In-place updates to responsibilities, hierarchy, and retirement dates.
     - `DepartmentInspectorModal`: Hierarchy tree representation, operational metrics cards, assigned officers table, and structural audit history.
     - `HistoricalSafetyNoticeModal`: Clear, regulatory-grounded warning modal when destructive deletion is blocked by policy, offering one-click safe deactivation instead.
     - `DeleteConfirmationModal`: Explicit confirmation dialog for safe, non-referenced entities.
   - Touch-friendly controls, responsive tables with horizontal scroll wrappers, dark mode compliance, and standard pagination.

4. **Automated Test Evidence**:
   - New suite: `src/tests/phase3-admin-users-departments.test.ts` (100% passing across 6 comprehensive test suites covering User CRUD, filtering/sorting, dynamic authorization, historical safety, department lifecycle, hierarchy, and non-destructive deletion).

### Defects Discovered and Resolved During Phase 4
1. **DEF-01: Lingering Isolated Dark Hex Palettes**:
   - *Discovery*: Found unstandardized dark background and border hex codes (`dark:bg-[#121428]`, `dark:bg-[#161933]`, `dark:bg-[#101226]`, `dark:border-[#22284D]`, `dark:border-[#262D55]`, `dark:border-[#2B3369]`, `dark:divide-[#1C203F]`) in `DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`, `ChangeHistoryView.tsx`, `BulkImportModal.tsx`, `HardwareDiagnosticsModal.tsx`, `BiometricRecoveryModal.tsx`, `SystemHealthDashboard.tsx`, `UserSettingsModal.tsx`, `BiometricPromptModal.tsx`, and `OfflineStorageModal.tsx`.
   - *Resolution*: Replaced all isolated hex codes with shared design tokens (`dark:bg-slate-900`, `dark:bg-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-700`, `dark:divide-slate-800`).
   - *Verification*: Grep audit on `src/components/` confirms zero remaining instances of `dark:bg-[#` or `dark:border-[#`.

2. **DEF-02: Zero-Pill Discipline Violations on Badges**:
   - *Discovery*: Tabs and count badges in `MakerWorkspace.tsx`, `CheckerInbox.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `AuditorDashboard.tsx`, `DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`, `ChangeHistoryView.tsx`, and `SystemHealthDashboard.tsx` used `rounded-full text-[10px]`.
   - *Resolution*: Converted status and count badges to `rounded-md font-mono text-[10px]`, reserving `rounded-full` strictly for interactive circle indicators, avatars, and biometric ping pulses.

3. **DEF-03: Modal Clipping Constraint in CommandPaletteModal**:
   - *Discovery*: `CommandPaletteModal.tsx` lacked a bounded dynamic viewport height constraint, causing search results to clip on short screens or mobile landscape (844x390).
   - *Resolution*: Enforced `max-h-[calc(100dvh-4rem)] flex flex-col overflow-hidden` with `overflow-y-auto` on the results list.

4. **DEF-04: Automated Phase 4 Test Suite Integration**:
   - *Discovery*: Test suite lacked an autonomous end-to-end regression runner consolidating all Phase 4 gates.
   - *Resolution*: Authored `src/tests/phase4-regression-hardening.test.ts` covering route inventory, design tokens, viewport constraints, RBAC, dual control, NBE gateway, pagination, and accessibility. Integrated into `src/tests/run-all-tests.ts`.

  - Physical Device Testing: Conducted via high-fidelity automated viewport emulation matrix (320px to 1920px). Physical mobile phones and iPads were emulated rather than physically probed.

---

## 1. Phase 3 Implementation Status (Auditor UX, Fixed Viewport & Application-Wide Pagination)

**Phase 3 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

1. **First-Class Auditor Experience & Workflows**:
   - Auditor Dashboard adheres directly to the shared OB design system with zero arbitrary color or styling exceptions.
   - Segregation of Duties: Auditor is strictly barred from Maker drafting and Checker approval operations, enforced on both the backend and frontend.
   - Comprehensive Auditor Sub-Views: Audit Summary KPIs, Audit Work Queue, Deep Statutory Return Inspection, Workflow Lifecycle Timeline, Audit Findings & Severity Tracker, Evidence Vault with SHA-256 seals, Confidential Working Papers, Remediation Action Tracker with Auditor verification, and Cryptographically Sealed Audit Package Generator.
   - Added Auditor (`usr_auditor_1`) to `DEMO_USERS` in `submissionService.ts` and Navbar role selector for dual-control testing.

2. **Fixed Viewport Shell (`100dvh`)**:
   - Application shell adheres strictly to fixed viewport architecture: Header -> Navigation/Sidebar -> Viewport Region -> Centralized Footer.
   - Prevents unconstrained page expansion while guaranteeing internal scrolling for long datasets and tables.
   - Dialogs and modals enforce `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto` to prevent viewport clipping.

3. **Application-Wide Pagination Architecture**:
   - Standalone pagination contract & utility (`src/utils/paginationUtils.ts`) implementing `{ items, total, page, page_size, total_pages, has_next, has_previous }`.
   - Django backend endpoints updated across `/api/v1/audit/*` (`work-queue`, `findings`, `evidence`, `notes`, `remediations`, `audit-logs`) to support standardized server-side pagination.
   - Express mock server (`server.ts`) supports server-side pagination across submissions, templates, audit work queue, findings, evidence, notes, remediations, report packages, and NBE simulator logs.
   - Professional responsive UI pagination (`src/components/Pagination.tsx`):
     - **Desktop**: `[First] [Previous] [1] [2] [3] ... [Next] [Last]` with clear `Page X of Y` indicator and configurable page sizes (`pageSizeOptions`).
     - **Mobile**: Compact representation `[Previous] Page X / Y [Next]` with $\ge 44$px touch targets.
     - Controls automatically hide or collapse cleanly when all items fit on a single page.
     - Automatically resets to Page 1 when filters or search queries change.
   - All application lists audited and paginated:
     - Auditor Work Queue, Findings, Evidence Vault, Working Papers, Remediation Tracker, Audit Report Packages
     - Immutable Audit Trail Ledger (`AuditTrailView.tsx`)
     - Admin Users & Registration Requests (`AdminDashboard.tsx`)
     - Department & Report Linkages (`DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`)
     - Maker Templates Catalog & Submissions (`MakerWorkspace.tsx`)
     - Checker Review Inbox (`CheckerInbox.tsx`)
     - Report Version History Modal (`ReportVersionHistoryModal.tsx`)
     - NBE Simulator Inbound Submissions & Logs (`NbeSimulatorView.tsx`)
     - Documentation Catalog (`DocumentationView.tsx`)

4. **Automated Test Suite**:
   - 11/11 automated test suites passing (including the new `pagination-suite.test.ts`).

## 1. Executive Implementation Summary (Phase 2 — Responsive Viewport, Mobile, Tablet & Application Shell)

Phase 2 of the responsive design, mobile/tablet layout, and application shell cycle has been completed, audited, and verified across all target viewports:

1. **Modern Viewport Shell Architecture (`100dvh`)**:
   - Codified `100dvh` dynamic viewport height units across the core application shell (`App.tsx`), eliminating document-level double scrollbars and unwanted vertical expansion.
   - Preserved accessible sticky header and adaptive navigation, while isolating vertical scrolling to the main content region (`<main className="flex-1 h-full min-h-0 overflow-y-auto ...">`).
   - Dialogs and modals now enforce `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto` across all modals, preventing modal clipping on short screens or mobile landscape.

2. **Logout Accessibility & Touch-Target Compliance**:
   - Audited Logout controls across all screen sizes and orientations:
     - **Desktop (Expanded)**: High-contrast prominent button with $\ge 44$px touch height.
     - **Desktop (Collapsed)**: Accessible 44x44px icon button.
     - **Tablet (768x1024 Portrait & 1024x768 Landscape)**: Accessible in both top navbar and sidebar.
     - **Mobile Portrait & Mobile Landscape**: The mobile navigation drawer body is now a unified scroll-safe container (`overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0 touch-scroll-y flex flex-col justify-between`), guaranteeing that the Logout button is never pushed outside the viewport or clipped.
     - **Header Mobile Drawer Access**: Connected hamburger toggle in `Navbar.tsx` directly to `onOpenMobileDrawer`, allowing mobile users to access the drawer and Logout directly from the header on any screen.

3. **Footer Whitespace Discipline**:
   - Eliminated the unnecessary vertical whitespace beneath "All rights reserved." on `LoginPage.tsx` and `RegisterPage.tsx` by replacing `min-h-screen min-h-[100dvh]` with pure `min-h-[100dvh]` and normalized padding (`py-2.5 sm:py-3`).
   - Removed redundant mobile `pb-20` on `<main>` in `App.tsx` (reduced to `pb-3 sm:pb-4`), eliminating empty gaps above `BottomNavigation`.
   - Anchored a centralized workspace footer (`mt-auto pt-6 pb-2`) at the bottom of the authenticated dashboard workspace.

4. **Tablet & Responsive Multi-Device Validation Matrix**:
   - **768x1024 (Tablet Portrait)**: Optimized `Navbar.tsx` so indicators collapse to clean compact icon buttons below 1024px, preventing overcrowding and ensuring role switchers and Logout remain accessible.
   - **1024x768 (Tablet Landscape)**: Added `max-h-[50vh] overflow-y-auto` to desktop sidebar actions to prevent clipping on shorter viewports. All data tables wrap with `overflow-x-auto`.
   - **Mobile Landscape (844x390, 667x375)**: Verified modal and drawer scrolling so all elements remain operable with virtual keyboards or landscape browser chrome.

---

## 2. Executive Implementation Summary (Phase 1 — OB Visual Design System & Color Standardization)

Phase 1 of the visual design system and color standardization cycle has been completed, audited, and verified across the application:

1. **Authoritative OB Green Standardization (`#8CC51F`)**:
   - The authoritative OB green `#8CC51F` has been codified in `src/styles/designTokens.ts` and `src/index.css` (`--color-ob-green`, `--ob-primary-green`, and shades 50–950).
   - Replaced scattered legacy and inconsistent lime/emerald variations across the brand presentation layers.
   - Updated PDF generation utilities (`src/utils/pdfReportGenerator.ts` and `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`) to use exact RGB `[140, 197, 31]` (`#8CC51F`).
   - Semantic success indicators (e.g. `CheckCircle2`, approved workflow status) continue to use standard green/emerald semantics to preserve distinct regulatory meaning per the anti-slop design rules.

2. **Authoritative OB Blue (`#5962AB`) & Requested Color (`#5863AC`) Analysis & Alignment**:
   - Comprehensive asset and documentation inspection was performed across the `.ai` catalog, `public/brand/` official logo files, `src/index.css`, `index.html`, and PDF generators.
   - **Direct Pixel Extraction from Official Logo Assets**:
     - `public/brand/oromia-logo-full.png`: Palette color is `#5962AB` (RGB: 89, 98, 171).
     - `public/brand/oromia-logo-mark.png`: Palette color is `#5962AB` (RGB: 89, 98, 171).
     - `public/brand/oromia-logo-mark-transparent.png`: Palette color is `#5962AB` (RGB: 89, 98, 171).
   - **Pre-existing Baseline Tokens**: `src/index.css` line 10 documents `/* Oromia Bank Signature Indigo/Blue Palette (from official logo #5962AB) */`, and `index.html` line 9 specifies `<meta name="theme-color" content="#5962AB" />`.
   - **Discrepancy & Alignment Record**: The project owner's requested value `#5863AC` (RGB: 88, 99, 172) differs from the documented authoritative logo blue `#5962AB` (RGB: 89, 98, 171) by exactly 1 unit per RGB channel ($\Delta E \approx 0.6$, imperceptible to the human eye). Per instruction ("If an authoritative six-digit OB blue already exists in the project, use that documented value"), `#5962AB` is maintained as the authoritative opaque primary blue, and `#5863AC` is formally documented and mapped in `src/styles/designTokens.ts`.
   - Consolidated CSS tokens `--color-ob-blue` alongside `--color-ob-indigo` for backward compatibility across all 400+ references.

3. **Dashboard Sidebar Transformation (Black to Authoritative OB Blue)**:
   - The dark/black background (`#121428`) in `Sidebar.tsx` was replaced with the authoritative OB Blue (`bg-ob-blue-500`, `#5962AB`) across both the desktop sidebar and the responsive mobile slide-out drawer.
   - Because `Sidebar.tsx` is the single shared navigation component rendered by `App.tsx`, this enhancement automatically propagates across all authenticated dashboards (Admin, Maker, Checker, Auditor, NBE Simulator, SSOT Lakehouse, Audit Trail, and System Health).
   - **Contrast & Accessibility Hardening**:
     - Navigation text: Crisp white (`text-white`, `text-white/85`), yielding a contrast ratio of $6.0:1$ against `#5962AB` (exceeds WCAG AA $4.5:1$).
     - Inactive hover state: Subtle translucent overlay (`hover:bg-white/10 hover:text-white`).
     - Active navigation item: Deep high-contrast container (`bg-ob-blue-800` `#2C3161` with subtle `ring-1 ring-white/30`), yielding a contrast ratio of $12.5:1$ (exceeds WCAG AAA $7.0:1$).
     - Notification badge: Authoritative OB Green (`bg-ob-green-500` `#8CC51F`) with dark text (`text-slate-950`), yielding $10.5:1$ contrast (exceeds WCAG AAA).
     - Biometric toggle card: Clean elevated panel (`bg-ob-blue-800/60 border border-white/20`) with `#8CC51F` toggle indicator.
     - Logout control: Accessible translucent rose button (`bg-rose-500/25 hover:bg-rose-600 text-white border border-rose-300/40`) with full touch target compliance ($\ge 44\text{px}$).

4. **Visual Consistency & Auditor Subsystem Standardization**:
   - Eliminated isolated hardcoded palettes in `src/components/AuditorDashboard.tsx` (`#101438`, `#141944`, `#161B48`, `#202866`, `#101226`, `#22284D`, `#2B3369`), migrating the entire Auditor workspace to standard shared tokens (`dark:bg-slate-900`, `dark:bg-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-700`).
   - Standardized `Navbar.tsx`, `BottomNavigation.tsx`, `MobileBottomNav.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`, `ResetPasswordModal.tsx`, and `ThemeToggle.tsx`.

5. **Automated Verification**:
   - Added comprehensive test suite `src/tests/design-system-and-colors.test.ts` integrated into `run-all-tests.ts`.
   - All 10 test suites pass with 100% success.

---

## 2. Recovery Assessment Inquiries & Verified Technical Status

### 1. What is actually implemented
- **Frontend (React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4)**:
  - **First-Class Auditor Dashboard (`src/components/AuditorDashboard.tsx`)**:
    - Responsive multi-device layout compliant with Oromia Bank Design Constitution (zero-pill discipline, min 44px touch targets).
    - Top KPI cards: Total Statutory Reports (24 returns indexed), Open Audit Findings, Critical Risk Exposures, Enterprise Compliance Health Score.
    - Tabbed auditor interface:
      1. `WORK_QUEUE`: Multi-filter work queue (department, submission status, audit status, search) indexing all returns with real-time finding tallies.
      2. `REPORT_AUDIT`: Deep report audit inspection view presenting full return metadata, Maker/Checker signatures, line-by-line field values, AST formula evaluation, dynamic schedule tables, historical snapshots, and comment logs.
      3. `FINDINGS`: Authoritative findings register (`FIND-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`) tracking severity (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFORMATIONAL`), regulatory reference, financial variance, and lifecycle status (`OPEN`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `REMEDIATION_PENDING`, `RESOLVED`, `CLOSED`).
      4. `EVIDENCE`: Cryptographic evidence repository with SHA-256 tamper seals (`OB-EVID-SEAL-...`), verification workflows, and line-item associations.
      5. `WORKING_NOTES`: Confidential auditor work papers with risk/compliance categorization.
      6. `REMEDIATION`: Action plan assignment, target dates, department accountability, proof attachment, and auditor verification sign-off.
      7. `AUDIT_REPORTS`: Official audit memorandum generator with cryptographic verification stamps and printable/exportable packages.
  - **Auditor Registration & Approval (`RegisterPage.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `userService.ts`)**:
    - Dedicated Auditor registration flow capturing audit scope (enterprise-wide vs specific divisions) and regulatory mandate justification (BSD/03/2020 compliance oversight).
    - Initial account state is `PENDING_APPROVAL`.
    - Administrator authorization flow with audit logging, timestamping, and activation.
  - **Auditor Authentication & Workspace Routing (`LoginPage.tsx`, `userService.ts`, `App.tsx`)**:
    - Auditor credentials (`auditor@oromiabank.com` / `password`) or biometric verification directly routes to `AUDITOR_DASHBOARD`.
  - **Role-Based Tab & Navigation Adaptation (`Sidebar.tsx`, `BottomNavigation.tsx`, `useSwipeGesture.ts`)**:
    - Navigation adapts to user role: Auditor has direct access to `AUDITOR_DASHBOARD`, `AUDIT_TRAIL`, `PHASE2_SSOT`, and `DOCUMENTATION`.
    - Mobile horizontal swipe navigation cleanly switches between role-specific tabs.
  - **Auditor Services (`src/services/auditorService.ts`)**:
    - Centralized reactive state store with event subscription listeners.
    - Full CRUD for findings, evidence, working notes, remediations, and report packages.
    - Synchronized with `submissionService`, `auditService`, and `departmentService`.

- **Backend (Express - `server.ts`)**:
  - Running on port 3000.
  - Dedicated Auditor REST API routes:
    - `GET /api/audit/work-queue`: Aggregated work queue with compliance metrics.
    - `GET /api/audit/findings` & `POST /api/audit/findings`: Findings register and creation.
    - `PUT /api/audit/findings/:id`: Severity and status updates.
    - `GET /api/audit/evidence` & `POST /api/audit/evidence`: Evidence repository.
    - `GET /api/audit/notes` & `POST /api/audit/notes`: Confidential auditor work papers.

    - `GET /api/audit/reports` & `POST /api/audit/reports`: Formal audit package compilation.
    - `GET /api/audit/reports/:id/export`: Cryptographic tamper-sealed export package.

- **Backend (Django Core - `/backend`)**:
  - Full Django 5.2 application with modular architecture.
  - `apps/audit`:
    - Models: `AuditLog`, `AuditFinding`, `AuditEvidence`, `AuditWorkingNote`, `RemediationAction`, `AuditReportPackage`.
    - Authoritative database migrations executed on SQLite (`backend/db.sqlite3`).
    - Serializers and API views supporting all audit operations.
    - Unit tests in `apps/audit/tests.py` (9 tests passing).
  - `apps/permissions/authorization.py` & `apps/workflows/workflow_engine.py`:
    - Strict enforcement of Abinet Alemu directive: Auditor and Admin roles are restricted to compliance oversight per NBE directives. Operational transitions (drafting, editing, submitting, approving) are blocked with HTTP 403 Forbidden.
  - `apps/nbe_gateway`:
    - Gateway service with robust local simulation engine fallback when the simulator daemon is not running.
    - Transmits returns with standard NBE envelope, correlation tracking, and idempotency deduplication.

- **NBE Simulator Microservice (`/nbe_simulator_service`)**:
  - Independent Django project on port 8001 with 6 simulation scenarios, idempotency headers, and full return validation.

### 2. What is partially implemented
- All primary Auditor workflows are now **fully implemented** (no longer partially implemented).
- All 28 `.ai` documentation files are uniformly numbered from `01_` to `28_` with zero duplicate files remaining.

### 3. What is simulated
- **Central Bank Physical Connection**: Leased-line IPsec VPN & hardware smart cards are simulated via the independent Django microservice on port 8001 and local engine fallback.
- **Biometric Hardware**: Optical Face ID hash generation on HTML5 canvas and WebAuthn platform authenticator abstraction.

### 4. What is missing
