# 00 - OB REGULATORY REPORTING GATEWAY — MASTER AI INDEX & START HERE

You are continuing development on the **Oromia Bank NBE Regulatory Reporting Platform**, a high-precision, production-grade regulatory reporting, validation, simulation, and data integration gateway engineered for the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) regulatory framework under Bank Supervision Directorate (BSD) directives.

## 1. Executive Instructions for Incoming AI Sessions

**DO NOT REINVENT OR REDESIGN THE APPLICATION.**  
**DO NOT START FROM SCRATCH.**  
The repository represents a fully functioning, tested full-stack banking application. Your primary responsibility is to maintain architectural integrity, adhere strictly to the Single Source of Truth (SSOT), and continue implementation autonomously without scope creep.

### Standard Verification Commands
Verify system health before and after every engineering operation:
```bash
# 1. Static type checking (must be 0 errors)
npm run lint

# 2. Automated test suite (Theme, Formula AST, Validation, RBAC, Workflows, Auditor, NBE Simulator, SSOT)
npx tsx src/tests/run-all-tests.ts

# 3. Production Vite build compilation
npm run build
```

## 3. Recommended Reading Order for a New AI Session

When initializing a new session or resuming development, read documents in this exact logical order:

### Phase A: Orientation & State Verification (Mandatory First 5 Minutes)
1. **`.ai/00_START_HERE.md`** (This file) — Map the knowledge base, verify rules, and review commands.
2. **`.ai/04_PROJECT_MEMORY.md`** — Review current system baseline, institutional parameters, and tech stack facts.
3. **`.ai/13_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** — Review verified modules, viewports, and passing completion gates.
4. **`.ai/25_TASK_QUEUE.md`** — Locate your assigned task, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and status.

### Phase B: Core Domain & System Architecture
5. **`.ai/01_MASTER_AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEER.md`** — Understand identity, authentication, biometrics, and security requirements.
6. **`.ai/02_OB_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`** — Understand overall platform rules, report lifecycle, and UI standards.

8. **`.ai/07_SSOT.md`** — Review Single Source of Truth governance and authoritative file locations.

### Phase C: Regulatory & Compliance Deep Dive
9. **`.ai/08_DEPARTMENT_CATALOG.md`** — Understand 8 bank departments and isolation rules.
10. **`.ai/09_REPORT_CATALOG.md`** & **`.ai/10_REPORT_SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md`** — Understand the 24 NBE returns, field schemas, and formulas.
11. **`.ai/11_NBE_CONTRACT.md`** & **`.ai/18_NBE_SIMULATOR_MICROSERVICE.md`** — Understand NBE intake gateway and 6 simulation scenarios.

## 4. Mandatory Post-Migration & ZIP Transfer Protocol

After every ZIP archive migration or repository transfer between AI Studio accounts:
1. **Inspect `.ai/` directory**: Ensure no temporary or competing files were created.
2. **Verify Canonical Filenames**: Every engineering document must adhere to `NUMBER_CANONICAL_NAME.md` (`00_` to `28_`).
3. **Detect & Eliminate Duplicates**: If any duplicate or unnumbered document appears, compare content immediately, preserve unique valid information in the canonical document, and remove the duplicate.
4. **Repair Broken References**: Never leave unnumbered references (e.g. `02_OB_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`); point them directly to canonical files (e.g. `.ai/02_OB_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`).
5. **Never Create Competing Specifications**: Maintain exactly one canonical document per engineering subject.
6. **Consult `.ai/20_ACCOUNT_MIGRATION_AND_CONTINUATION.md`** for detailed continuation protocols and quota-safety rules.

## 5. Architectural Non-Negotiables

- **Runtime**: Node.js full-stack Express server listening on **port 3000** (`server.ts`). Mounts Vite middleware in dev and serves `dist/` in prod.
- **No Django Backend**: Node.js and Express are authoritative for all API routes, storage, and mock simulation.
- **Frontend Design Constitution**: Oromia Bank primary palette (Green `#8CC51F`, Blue `#5962AB`, Gold `#DDA63A`). Zero-pill discipline on static metadata. Dual icon+text indicators for accessibility.
- **Security & RBAC**: Defense-in-depth, 4-eyes segregation of duties, immutable audit trail, non-repudiation evidence seals.
