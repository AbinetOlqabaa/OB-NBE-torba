## [1.9.0-phase5-final-verification-and-completion-gate] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Phase 5 Automated End-to-End Verification Test Suite (`src/tests/phase5-final-verification.test.ts`)**:
  - Implemented automated verification of all 14 mandatory end-to-end flows:
    1. Admin Login & Dashboard Routing
    2. Maker Login & Workspace Routing
    3. Checker Login & Inbox Routing
    4. Auditor Login & Independent Dashboard Routing
    5. User Registration & Admin Approval Flow
    6. Password Authentication & Zero-Bypass Checks
    7. Biometric Passkey (WebAuthn) & Optical Face ID Enrollment
    8. Biometric Authentication & Verification (distinguishing Code Verified from physical hardware unavailability in headless CI)
    9. Complete Maker Reporting Lifecycle (Create -> Save -> Edit -> Submit)
    10. Complete Checker Review Lifecycle (Review -> Request Correction -> Re-review -> Approve)
    11. Auditor Independent Inspection Lifecycle (Work Queue -> Findings -> Evidence -> Remediations -> Working Notes -> Audit Package)
    12. Central Bank Transmission to NBE Gateway (Receipt number, delivery timestamp, idempotency)
    13. User Session Logout Flow & Audit Trail Attribution
    14. Deliberate Unauthorized Access Attempts (Maker self-approval blocked, Checker NBE delivery blocked, Cross-department submission blocked)
- **Unified Full-Stack Test Command (`npm run test:all`)**:
  - Chains TypeScript/React unit & integration tests (`npm test`), Django backend app tests (`npm run test:backend`), and NBE simulator microservice tests (`npm run test:simulator`).
- **Python Dependencies in Backend Requirements (`backend/requirements.txt`)**:
  - Added `requests>=2.31.0` and validated execution against Django 5.2.

### Verified
- **Architectural & Security Integrity**:
  - Multi-tier architecture: React SPA -> Node/Express Proxy -> Django Core Services -> SQLite DB -> NBE Gateway Service -> NBE Simulator Daemon.
  - Zero-bypass authorization: Operational actions (create, edit, approve, deliver) rejected by backend when attempted by unauthorized roles or across department boundaries.
  - 4-Eyes principle enforced both client-side and server-side.
- **Completion Gates**:
  - All 12 completion gates evaluated and certified **PASS**.

## [1.8.0-phase4-ui-ux-regression-and-hardening] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Automated Phase 4 Regression & Hardening Test Suite (`src/tests/phase4-regression-hardening.test.ts`)**:
  - Full route and component inventory verification covering 22 distinct views, workspaces, and modals.
  - Verification of authoritative brand tokens (`#8CC51F` green, `#5962AB` blue, `#2C3161` active item, `#47509A` border).
  - Validation of zero isolated dark hex code policy across all application components.
  - End-to-end reporting lifecycle and dual-control workflow test: Maker draft creation -> Checker approval -> Maker transmission to NBE simulator.
  - Non-color accessibility and semantic status indicator audits.
  - Standalone pagination contract verification with edge case clamping.
- **Integrated Test Execution Runner**:
  - Expanded `src/tests/run-all-tests.ts` to 12 comprehensive automated test suites (100% passing).

### Changed
- **Application-Wide Color Standardization & Hex Eradication**:
  - Eliminated lingering isolated dark hex codes (`dark:bg-[#121428]`, `dark:bg-[#161933]`, `dark:bg-[#101226]`, `dark:border-[#22284D]`, `dark:border-[#262D55]`, `dark:border-[#2B3369]`, `dark:divide-[#1C203F]`) across `DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`, `ChangeHistoryView.tsx`, `BulkImportModal.tsx`, `HardwareDiagnosticsModal.tsx`, `BiometricRecoveryModal.tsx`, `SystemHealthDashboard.tsx`, `UserSettingsModal.tsx`, `BiometricPromptModal.tsx`, and `OfflineStorageModal.tsx`.
  - Migrated entirely to unified design tokens (`dark:bg-slate-900`, `dark:bg-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-800`, `dark:border-slate-700`, `dark:divide-slate-800`).
- **Zero-Pill Discipline Across Workspace Badges & Tabs**:
  - Replaced `rounded-full text-[10px]` with `rounded-md font-mono text-[10px]` on counts and status tags in `MakerWorkspace.tsx`, `CheckerInbox.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `AuditorDashboard.tsx`, `DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`, `ChangeHistoryView.tsx`, and `SystemHealthDashboard.tsx`.
- **Viewport Immunity on Modal Dialogs**:
  - Hardened `CommandPaletteModal.tsx` with dynamic height constraints (`max-h-[calc(100dvh-4rem)] flex flex-col overflow-hidden` and `overflow-y-auto` results) to eliminate any risk of viewport clipping on short displays or mobile landscape.

---

## [1.7.0-phase3-auditor-ux-and-pagination] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Design System Rule Injected into Master Prompts (`/.ai/02_MASTER_PROMPT.md`, `/.ai/MASTER_PROMPT.md`)**:
  - Formal rule prohibiting page-specific overrides when solutions belong to shared design tokens, themes, components, or application shells.
- **Account Migration Protocol (`/.ai/ACCOUNT_MIGRATION_PROTOCOL.md`)**:
  - Permanent protocol guaranteeing self-contained project state reconstruction for subsequent AI Studio sessions.
- **First-Class Auditor Workflow & Integration (`src/components/AuditorDashboard.tsx`)**:
  - Full adherence to the shared OB design system (zero arbitrary custom color tokens).
  - Complete integration of Auditor sub-views: Audit Summary KPIs, Audit Work Queue, Statutory Return Deep Inspection, Lifecycle Workflow Timeline, Audit Findings & Severity Tracker, Evidence Vault with SHA-256 seals, Confidential Working Papers, Remediation Action Tracker with Auditor verification, and Cryptographically Sealed Audit Package Generator.
  - Added Auditor demo user (`usr_auditor_1`) to `DEMO_USERS` in `src/services/submissionService.ts` and Navbar role switcher for dual-control testing.
- **Standalone Server & Client Pagination Architecture (`src/utils/paginationUtils.ts`)**:
  - Contract: `{ items, total, page, page_size, total_pages, has_next, has_previous }`.
  - Backend integration: Express routes (`server.ts`) and Django views (`backend/apps/audit/views.py`) supporting query parameters `page`, `page_size`, and `limit`.
- **Responsive Standard Pagination UI (`src/components/Pagination.tsx`)**:
  - Desktop: `[First] [Previous] [1] [2] [3] ... [Next] [Last]` with `Page X of Y` indicator and configurable page sizes.
  - Mobile: Compact responsive representation `[Previous] Page X / Y [Next]` with $\ge 44$px touch targets.
  - Automatic control hiding when all items fit on a single page.
- **Application-Wide List Audit & Pagination Implementation**:
  - Auditor Dashboard: Work Queue, Findings, Evidence Vault, Working Papers, Remediation Tracker, and Audit Packages.
  - Version History: `ReportVersionHistoryModal.tsx` paginated with dynamic sizing.
  - Audit Trail Ledger: `AuditTrailView.tsx` resets to Page 1 upon search query or filter modifications.
- **Automated Test Suite for Pagination (`src/tests/pagination-suite.test.ts`)**:
  - Unit tests covering 0 records, 1 record, exact 1 page, exact 2 pages, safe out-of-bounds page clamping, 1,250-record datasets, and dynamic page-size changes.

## [1.6.0-phase2-responsive-viewport-and-application-shell] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Modern 100dvh Application Shell Architecture (`src/App.tsx`, `src/index.css`)**:
  - Established a controlled application shell utilizing `100dvh` viewport units without document-level expansion or blind `overflow:hidden` clipping.
  - Header and navigation remain accessible at all times while the dynamic workspace provides a controlled internal scrolling region (`overflow-y-auto min-h-0 flex-1`).
  - Added centralized application workspace footer inside `<main>` with `mt-auto pt-6 pb-2` ensuring proper bottom anchoring without awkward gaps or floating.
- **Header Mobile Drawer Access (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)**:
  - Added `onOpenMobileDrawer` prop to `Navbar`, allowing mobile users to open the navigation drawer directly from the header hamburger button on any viewport orientation or when editing reports.
  - Responsive tablet header optimization: compact indicator presentation on `< 1024px` preserving ample breathing room at 768px tablet portrait.
- **Scroll-Safe Mobile Navigation Drawer (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)**:
  - Converted mobile drawer body into a unified, scroll-safe container (`overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0 touch-scroll-y flex flex-col justify-between`).
  - Guarantees that the Logout control, user profile, and hardware preferences are NEVER pushed outside the viewport or clipped on mobile landscape (e.g., 844x390, 667x375).
- **Responsive Dialog & Modal Constraints**:
  - Enforced `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto` across all modals (`BiometricPromptModal`, `UserSettingsModal`, `ReportVersionHistoryModal`, `OfflineStorageModal`, `HardwareDiagnosticsModal`, `KeyboardShortcutsModal`, `CommandPaletteModal`, `BulkImportModal`, `BiometricRecoveryModal`).
- **Phase 2 Automated Test Matrix (`src/tests/responsive-ui-and-layout.test.ts`)**:
  - Added test suites for 100dvh shell architecture, Logout accessibility across mobile/tablet/desktop ($\ge 44$px touch targets), footer whitespace discipline, and tablet validation matrix (768x1024 portrait & 1024x768 landscape).

### Changed
- **Footer Whitespace Discipline (`src/components/LoginPage.tsx`, `src/components/RegisterPage.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`)**:
  - Removed unnecessary vertical empty space beneath "All rights reserved." on login and registration pages.
  - Replaced `min-h-screen min-h-[100dvh]` with pure `min-h-[100dvh]` and normalized footer padding (`py-2.5 sm:py-3`), preventing mobile address-bar height expansion.
  - Removed redundant mobile `pb-20` on `<main>` in `App.tsx` (reduced to `pb-3 sm:pb-4`), eliminating empty gaps above `BottomNavigation`.
- **Desktop Sidebar Height Protection (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)**:
  - Added `max-h-[50vh] overflow-y-auto` to the bottom actions container of the desktop sidebar, preventing clipping on short desktop or tablet landscape viewports (e.g. 1024x768 or 600px height).
  - Enforced $\ge 44$px touch targets on both expanded and collapsed Logout buttons.
- **Color Standardization Cleanups**:
  - Standardized remaining dark hex palettes in `DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `BiometricPromptModal.tsx`, `UserSettingsModal.tsx`, `BulkImportModal.tsx`, and `BiometricRecoveryModal.tsx` to shared tokens.
  - Updated `index.html` dark `theme-color` meta tag to `#0B0F19`.

  - Authoritative OB primary blue codified as `#5962AB` with calibrated tonal scales (50–950).
  - Documented requested color `#5863AC` with exact 1-RGB-point delta analysis against official logo assets.
  - Standardized surface, border, text, typography, semantic feedback, and sidebar token configurations.
- **CSS Variables & Tailwind v4 Theme Tokens (`src/index.css`)**:
  - Configured `:root` and `.dark` variables (`--ob-primary-green`, `--ob-primary-blue`, `--ob-sidebar-bg`, `--ob-sidebar-border`, `--ob-sidebar-text`, `--ob-sidebar-active-bg`, `--ob-sidebar-badge-bg`).
  - Added `--color-ob-blue` alongside `--color-ob-indigo` for 100% backward compatibility.
  - Standardized `--color-ob-green` to `#8CC51F`.
- **Automated Test Suite for Design System & Colors (`src/tests/design-system-and-colors.test.ts`)**:
  - Added 5 test sections validating color values, token mapping, sidebar container classes, visual consistency, and WCAG AA/AAA contrast ratios.
  - Integrated into `src/tests/run-all-tests.ts` (10 comprehensive test suites, 100% pass).

### Changed
- **Dashboard Sidebar Visual Transformation (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)**:
  - Replaced the dark/black background (`#121428`) with the authoritative OB Blue (`bg-ob-blue-500`, `#5962AB`) across both the desktop sidebar and the responsive mobile slide-out drawer.
  - Automatically propagated across all authenticated dashboards (Admin, Maker, Checker, Auditor, NBE Simulator, SSOT Lakehouse, Audit Trail, and System Health).
  - Enhanced contrast: navigation text in high-legibility white ($6.0:1$), active item in deep blue `#2C3161` ($12.5:1$), and notification badges in authoritative OB green `#8CC51F` ($10.5:1$).
- **Application-Wide Color Standardization**:
  - Standardized `AuditorDashboard.tsx` by eliminating isolated dark hex palettes (`#101438`, `#141944`, `#161B48`, `#202866`, `#101226`, `#22284D`, `#2B3369`) and unifying with shared tokens.
  - Standardized `Navbar.tsx`, `BottomNavigation.tsx`, `MobileBottomNav.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`, `ResetPasswordModal.tsx`, `ReportVersionHistoryModal.tsx`, and `ThemeToggle.tsx`.
  - Updated PDF generators (`src/utils/pdfReportGenerator.ts` and `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`) to use `#8CC51F` (`[140, 197, 31]`).

## [1.4.0-auditor-first-class-role] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **First-Class Auditor Role & Regulatory Audit Workflow** (`.ai/19_AUDITOR_ROLE_AND_AUDIT_WORKFLOW.md`):
  - Implemented comprehensive `AuditorDashboard.tsx` with responsive multi-device design, zero-pill typography, and dark mode support.
  - Added dedicated Auditor registration workflow in `RegisterPage.tsx` capturing audit oversight scope and regulatory mandate justifications (BSD/03/2020).
  - Implemented Auditor approval workflow in `AdminDashboard.tsx` with administrative authorization and timestamping.
  - Implemented automatic redirection to `AUDITOR_DASHBOARD` upon auditor login in `LoginPage.tsx` and `userService.ts`.
  - Implemented **Audit Work Queue** with cross-departmental filtering (department, submission status, audit status, search query) and real-time finding aggregates.
  - Implemented **Deep Report Audit Inspection View** enabling line-by-line examination of submitted values, AST formulas, dynamic schedule tables, Maker/Checker signatures, and historical snapshots.
  - Implemented **Audit Findings Register** (`FIND-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`) tracking severity (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFORMATIONAL`), regulatory citations, financial variances, and lifecycle states (`OPEN`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `REMEDIATION_PENDING`, `RESOLVED`, `CLOSED`).
  - Implemented **Evidence Management Repository** with Oromia Bank cryptographic tamper seals (`OB-EVID-SEAL-...`) and verification workflows.
  - Implemented **Confidential Auditor Work Papers & Notes** categorized by risk, compliance, data quality, and general observations.
  - Implemented **Remediation Action Tracking** with assigned department accountability, target completion dates, proof verification, and auditor sign-off.
  - Implemented **Formal Audit Reports Generator & Export** compiling executive memorandums, findings summaries, and official cryptographic verification seals.
  - Implemented dedicated backend REST API endpoints in `server.ts` under `/api/audit/*` for work queue, findings, evidence, notes, remediations, and report exports.
  - Implemented Django backend models, serializers, views, and migrations in `backend/apps/audit/` (`AuditFinding`, `AuditEvidence`, `AuditWorkingNote`, `RemediationAction`, `AuditReportPackage`).
  - Enforced strict segregation of duties (Abinet Alemu directive): In `backend/apps/permissions/authorization.py` and `backend/apps/workflows/workflow_engine.py`, the Auditor role is barred from drafting, editing, submitting, or approving reports (compliance oversight boundary).
  - Added automated test suite `src/tests/auditor-workflow.test.ts` integrated into `src/tests/run-all-tests.ts` (10 test sections, 100% pass).
  - Added Django unit test suite `backend/apps/audit/tests.py` (9 tests, 100% pass).
  - Standardized all 28 `.ai` documentation files with uniform `number_` prefixes (`01_` through `28_`) and cleaned up all duplicate files.

## [1.3.0-auditor-assessment] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- **Full Recovery Assessment for Auditor Role Implementation** (`.ai/19_AUDITOR_ROLE_AND_AUDIT_WORKFLOW.md`):
  - Completed thorough inspection across the entire project and all `.ai` documentation.
  - Formulated precise answers for all 10 recovery inquiries in `.ai/13_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.
  - Clarified technical stack reality: both Express (`server.ts` port 3000), Django Core (`/backend` SQLite `db.sqlite3`), and Django NBE Simulator (`/nbe_simulator_service` SQLite `simulator_db.sqlite3` port 8001) are active and functional.
  - Cataloged gap analysis for first-class Auditor role: registration request, approval workflow, auditor dashboard, work queue, report audit view, revision history, evidence management, findings system (severity/status), audit notes, remediation tracking, formal audit reports, and Django boundary enforcement.

---

## [1.2.0-auth-seed-users] - 2026-09-28

### Removed
- **One-Click Role Login Visual Block**: Removed the testing shortcut button container (`ONE-CLICK ROLE LOGIN (TESTING)`) from `LoginPage.tsx`.
- **Underlying Shortcut/Bypass Logic**:
  - Removed `handleQuickPreset` and silent email default fallback in `LoginPage.tsx`.
  - Removed auto-provisioning bypass in `useBiometricAuth.ts` which previously generated fake simulated passkeys for unenrolled accounts.

  - `userService.resetDevelopmentSeedData()` resets seed accounts cleanly.
  - `userService.getDevelopmentSeedSummary()` outputs developer reference data.
  - `POST /api/auth/seed-data/reset` server endpoint with non-repudiation audit logging.
  - `GET /api/auth/seed-data` server endpoint for configuration tooling.
- **Collapsible Development Test Reference UI**:
  - Added clean reference accordion on `LoginPage.tsx` displaying accounts and roles.
  - Provides "Use Email" filler (populates email only, preserving real password validation) and "Reset Seed Data" trigger.
