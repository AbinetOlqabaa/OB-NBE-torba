## [37.0.0-phase37-cross-phase-integration-security-regression-and-acceptance] - 2026-10-03

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 37: Cross-Phase Integration, Security, Regression & Acceptance (`37_CROSS_PHASE_INTEGRATION_SECURITY_REGRESSION_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md`, `src/tests/phase37-cross-phase-integration-security-regression-and-acceptance.test.ts`)**:
  - **End-to-End Scenario 1: Import to Usable Report (Complete Admin → Maker Lifecycle)**:
    - Admin successfully imports NBE JSON report package; schema normalizer strips sample values and formats definitions into ReportDefinitionSSOT/ReportVersionSSOT.
    - Title, sections, columns, formulas, and NBE API endpoints validated and registered.
    - Published Version 1 to ACTIVE; appears in Admin NBE Simulator.
    - Department-authorized Maker creates a clean instance with unique submission ID, no sample data leakage, edits and saves draft, validates cleanly, and submits to designated Checker with ReviewerAssignment.
  - **End-to-End Scenario 2: Maker Cannot Alter Report Definition**:
    - Direct attempts by Maker to modify report title, code, formula, or API endpoint are strictly rejected by the server and UI (403 Forbidden / SECURITY_VIOLATION), preserving report definition integrity.
  - **End-to-End Scenario 3: Checker Assignment & Notification Workflow**:
    - Same-department active Checkers verified as eligible; cross-department and inactive Checkers excluded; Maker self-selection blocked under Segregation of Duties.
    - Assigned Checkers receive targeted smart notifications; cross-department users receive zero notifications.
  - **End-to-End Scenario 4: Dashboard Isolation & Role Segregation**:
    - Verified strict single-role dashboard isolation: Admin → Admin Dashboard only; Maker → Maker Workspace only; Checker → Checker Inbox only; Auditor → Auditor Dashboard only.
    - URL query, hash, popstate, sidebar, and command palette tampering strictly redirected.
  - **End-to-End Scenario 5: Empty-Template Behavior & Neutral Sanitization**:
    - Fresh reports initialize with empty strings and clean zero states without storing placeholder literals.
    - Mandatory fields missing input yield BLOCKING_ERROR with structured 4-part explanations (What is wrong, Why it matters, How to fix it, Expected format).
  - **End-to-End Scenario 6: Historical Safety & Template Version Evolution**:
    - Historical submissions preserve frozen template snapshots and exact original titles upon new version publication.
    - New submissions cleanly adopt active Version 2 definitions.
  - **Security Regression Matrix (Attack Surface Verification)**:
    - Cross-role route tampering, cross-department draft creation, forged submission IDs, non-admin endpoint/template tampering, cross-department notification leakage, duplicate reviewer assignment, optimistic concurrency conflicts (HTTP 409), duplicate review on settled returns, and self-approval strictly blocked and logged.
  - **Performance Benchmarks & Resilience Latency**:
    - JSON Import & Validation: ~1.0ms (< 50ms threshold).
    - Schema Normalization & Preview: ~2.0ms (< 30ms threshold).
    - Report Draft Initialization: ~0.3ms (< 25ms threshold).
    - Validation Evaluation: ~0.03ms (< 30ms threshold).
    - Notification Dispatch: ~0.05ms (< 15ms threshold).
    - Simulator Discovery: ~0.1ms (< 10ms threshold).
    - Library Query & Search: ~3.1ms (< 25ms threshold).
    - Dashboard Route Authorization: ~0.002ms (< 5ms threshold).
  - **Master Regression Harness Verification**:
    - All test suites (Phases 1 through 37) passing cleanly with 100% success rate.
    - `compile_applet` and `lint_applet` 100% error-free.

## [36.0.0-phase36-maker-selected-checker-assignment-and-notification-workflow] - 2026-10-03

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 36: Maker-Selected Checker Assignment & Notification Workflow (`36_MAKER_SELECTED_CHECKER_ASSIGNMENT_AND_NOTIFICATION_WORKFLOW.md`, `src/tests/phase36-maker-selected-checker-assignment-and-notification-workflow.test.ts`)**:
  - **Server-Side Checker Eligibility & Filtering (`effectiveAccessEngine.ts`)**:
    - Implemented `getEligibleCheckersForReport(reportKey, maker, submission)` and `validateCheckerSelection(reportKey, maker, selectedCheckerIds, submission)`.
    - Server-side criteria strictly enforces:
      1. Same-department assignment (or active Administrator-granted Special Cross-Department Access grant covering report/department).
      2. Active account status (excludes `DISABLED`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `SUSPENDED`).
      3. Designated `CHECKER` role.
      4. Segregation of duties / conflict-of-interest rules: Maker is strictly prohibited from selecting themselves or reviewing their own submitted reports.
      5. Safe reviewer representation: Only exposes safe, minimal profile data (`id`, `name`, `email`, `department`, `employeeId`, `status`, `authorizationReason`), with zero exposure of credentials, passwords, or biometrics.
  - **Single & Multi-Reviewer Selection & Assignment Records (`src/types/regulatory.ts`, `submissionService.ts`)**:
    - Added `ReviewerAssignment` interface and submission workflow record fields: `assignedCheckerIds`, `reviewerAssignments`, and `primaryCheckerId`.
    - Maker may select a single Checker or multiple co-reviewers directly in the submission flow.
    - Preserved a clear primary reviewer concept (`primaryCheckerId`, `isPrimary: boolean`, and backward-compatible `checkerId`, `checkerName`, `checkerEmail`, `checkerDepartment`).
    - Validation rejects duplicate reviewer selections and forged/tampered IDs with explicit security audit logging.
  - **4-Eyes Dual Control & Concurrency Governance**:
    - Review actions remain governed by NBE 4-eyes approval rules.
    - When specific reviewers are designated, unassigned Checkers are strictly blocked from reviewing the report.
    - A single authoritative review action transitions the report state:
      - When one assigned Checker approves, status transitions to `APPROVED`, recording the reviewing Checker and resolving secondary assignments as `SUPERSEDED`.
      - Subsequent review attempts by other assigned Checkers are safely prevented by authoritative state resolution (`INVALID_WORKFLOW_STATE: Duplicate review prevented: Submission has already been APPROVED`).
      - Conflicting actions (e.g. attempting to approve a rejected return) are blocked by authoritative workflow state rules.
    - Implemented `acceptReview(id, checkerUser)` method enabling a Checker to accept/open the review, marking assignment status as `ACCEPTED` and recording the review start timestamp.
  - **Authoritative Server-Generated Smart Notifications (`notificationService.ts`)**:
    - On submission, smart notifications (`WORKFLOW`, `HIGH` priority) are emitted to all assigned Checkers with direct links to `CHECKER_INBOX`.
    - Cross-department notification isolation strictly maintained (unauthorized Checkers receive zero assignment notifications).
    - When a Checker accepts/opens review, Maker receives immediate `Review In Progress` notification.
    - When review is completed, Maker receives instant review outcome notifications (Approval confirmation, Correction Request with reviewer notes, or Rejection reason).
  - **UI Reviewer Selector (`src/components/CheckerSelector.tsx`)**:
    - Embedded dynamic Checker Selector in both `DynamicReportForm.tsx` (report editor modal) and `MakerLibraryView.tsx` (library submission modal).
    - Features: "Select Checker(s)" with eligible counter, selected reviewer chips list, primary reviewer badge and toggle, active status indicators, and clear explanatory guidance when no eligible same-department Checkers exist.
  - **Authoritative Backend API Endpoints (`server.ts`)**:
    - `GET /api/regulatory/reports/:reportKey/eligible-checkers`
    - `POST /api/regulatory/submissions/:id/submit` (accepts `selectedCheckerIds: string[]`)
    - `POST /api/regulatory/submissions/:id/accept-review`
  - **Acceptance Testing Suite (`src/tests/phase36-maker-selected-checker-assignment-and-notification-workflow.test.ts`)**:
    - 15 comprehensive automated test gates covering same-department filtering, inactive/disabled exclusions, other-department exclusions, self-selection prevention, forged ID rejection, duplicate selection prevention, multi-reviewer persistence, smart notifications dispatch, unauthorized review prevention, review acceptance, Maker outcome notifications, duplicate/conflicting concurrency prevention, correction request workflow, special access reviewer eligibility, and audit trail validation.
    - Integrated into full regression harness `src/tests/run-all-tests.ts` with 100% pass rate.

## [35.0.0-phase35-role-locked-dashboards-and-notification-navigation] - 2026-10-03

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 35: Role-Locked Dashboards & Notification-Centered Navigation (`35_ROLE_LOCKED_DASHBOARDS_AND_NOTIFICATION_NAVIGATION.md`, `src/tests/phase35-role-locked-dashboards-and-notification-navigation.test.ts`)**:
  - **Required Role Access Model (Single-Role Workspaces)**:
    - `ADMIN` → Administrator Dashboard only (`ADMIN_DASHBOARD`, plus admin utilities `DEPT_REPORT_MANAGEMENT`, `NBE_SIMULATOR`, `PHASE2_SSOT`, `SYSTEM_HEALTH`). Cross-dashboard access to Maker Workspace, Checker Inbox, and Auditor Dashboard strictly prohibited.
    - `MAKER` → Maker Workspace only (`MAKER_WORKSPACE`, plus `LIBRARY`, `DOCUMENTATION`). Cross-dashboard access to Admin, Checker, Auditor, and NBE Simulator strictly prohibited.
    - `CHECKER` → Checker Inbox only (`CHECKER_INBOX`, plus `LIBRARY`, `AUDIT_TRAIL`, `DOCUMENTATION`). Cross-dashboard access to Admin, Maker, Auditor, and NBE Simulator strictly prohibited.
    - `AUDITOR` → Auditor Dashboard only (`AUDITOR_DASHBOARD`, plus `LIBRARY`, `AUDIT_TRAIL`, `DOCUMENTATION`). Cross-dashboard access to Admin, Maker, Checker, and NBE Simulator strictly prohibited.
  - **Rejection & Redirection Across All Navigation Channels**:
    - Navbar controls, dropdowns, direct URL parameters (`?tab=...`), hash navigation, browser popstate history, universal command palette (`Ctrl+K`), sidebar navigation, mobile bottom navigation, and swipe gestures are strictly role-locked.
    - Forged or unauthorized route access attempts trigger security audit logs and automatically redirect users to their role's authorized default dashboard.
  - **NBE Simulator Segregation**:
    - NBE Simulator completely removed from Maker, Checker, and Auditor dashboards.
    - Retained strictly in Administrator dashboard.
    - Backend endpoints (`/api/nbe-simulator/submissions`, `/api/nbe-simulator/logs`, `/api/nbe-simulator/scenario`) reject non-admin roles with 403 Forbidden.
  - **Navbar Transformation & Notification Bell**:
    - Eliminated the dashboard-switching dropdown (`<select aria-label="Switch User Role">`) from the authenticated navbar; replaced with authoritative read-only role indicator badge.
    - Added notification bell icon with live unread count badge.
    - Clicking the bell opens the user's accessible Notification Center dialog (`src/components/NotificationCenter.tsx`).
    - Authoritative server-side notification service (`src/services/notificationService.ts`) with endpoints `GET /api/notifications`, `POST /api/notifications/:id/read`, `POST /api/notifications/read-all`.
    - Sensible grouping into `WORKFLOW`, `GOVERNANCE`, `SECURITY`, and `SYSTEM` categories.
    - Read/unread toggle and mark-all-read support.
  - **Cross-Department Notification Leakage Protection**:
    - Server-side filtering strictly shields other departments' report keys and sensitive metadata from unauthorized makers and checkers.
  - **Maker Navbar Clutter Cleanup**:
    - Removed the two specified unimportant icons beside the OB logo (`Building2` / "Financial Year 2026" ribbon and `pendingCheckerCount` awaiting review badge) for Maker while preserving required navigation drawer toggles and accessibility controls.
  - **Accessibility & Touch Standards**:
    - Complies with WCAG 2.1 AA touch targets (min 44×44px), ARIA dialog attributes, and keyboard shortcuts.

## [30.0.0-phase30-full-integration-security-regression-acceptance] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 30: Full Integration, Security, Regression and Acceptance Pass (`src/tests/phase30-full-integration-security-regression-acceptance.test.ts`, `30_FULL_INTEGRATION_SECURITY_REGRESSION_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md`)**:
  - **Full 14 Required Acceptance Flows Executed & Verified (100% Green)**:
    - **Flow 1: Maker Draft Complete Lifecycle**: `create → edit → autosave → Library → reopen → edit → validate → submit` verified with real state persistence and snapshot capture on `LOA_ADV_OUT_LA001`.
    - **Flow 2: Reuse Submitted Report as New**: Submitted/approved report reused by Maker; verified source record is 100% immutable (hash, version, status untouched); new draft created with distinct ID, v1, DRAFT status, and source reference preserved.
    - **Flow 3: Validation Error/Warning Remediation Assistant**: Normalized validation items with 4-part structured explanations (`whatIsWrong`, `whyItMatters`, `howToFix`, `expectedFormat`); deterministic auto-fix applied to currency precision; authoritative revalidation confirmed problem genuinely resolved.
    - **Flow 4: Library Role Matrix & Deletion Governance**: Maker restricted to owned & department returns; Maker hard delete of submitted record blocked under Directive BSD/03/2020; Maker can delete unsubmitted drafts; Checker restricted to authorized review items; Auditor granted universal institutional read-only visibility; Administrator governed archiving with mandatory justification and confirmation.
    - **Flow 5: Explicit Confirmation on Destructive Actions**: Verified confirmation requirements on draft deletions, governed archiving, and logout. Short justifications (<10 chars) strictly blocked.
    - **Flow 6: Autosave Resilience & Offline Detection Fix**: Verified persistence across simulated page navigation, unmount, and reload. Resolved Node 22 `navigator.onLine` evaluation defect.
    - **Flow 7: Logout Confirmation Dialog & Save Flush Lifecycle**: Verified Cancel preserves active editing session; Confirm flushes pending edits to server before session destruction; wipes transient biometric state and revokes server session.
    - **Flow 8: Dashboard Responsibility Cleanup**: Verified that Maker, Checker, and Auditor dashboards contain zero traces of System Health telemetry or Phase 2 SSOT Lakehouse pipelines; Administrator retains both.
    - **Flow 9: Remember Me End-to-End Authentication**: Unchecked checkbox creates transient session only; checked checkbox issues 256-bit cryptographic token with SHA-256 server-side hash; explicit logout revokes session on server.
    - **Flow 10: Security Boundary & Rejection Enforcement**: Cross-department draft creation rejected; forged submission IDs return 404; biometric reset with incorrect password rejected; configuration proposal self-approval strictly rejected (4-eyes segregation).
    - **Flow 11: SSOT Optimistic Locking & Concurrency Control**: Stale expectedVersion throws `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION_CONFLICT` (HTTP 409), preventing lost updates and race conditions.
    - **Flow 12: Performance Benchmarking**: Verified sub-millisecond execution times: Library query & pagination = 1.56ms (< 25ms threshold); Validation normalization = 0.60ms (< 30ms threshold).
    - **Flow 13: Responsive Viewport Matrix Validation**: Verified layout adaptation across 8 target viewports: 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1366×768, 1024×768, 768×1024, 430×932, 390×844, and 320×568.
    - **Flow 14: Accessibility Compliance**: Verified ARIA dialog attributes, keyboard navigation shortcuts (`Ctrl+M`, `Ctrl+L`, `Ctrl+K`, `Ctrl+Shift+?`, `Escape`), and WCAG 2.1 AA >=44×44px touch targets.
  - **Defect Fixes**:
    - Fixed Node.js 22 runtime `navigator.onLine` detection in `submissionService.ts` and `auditService.ts` to check `typeof navigator.onLine === 'boolean'`, preventing erroneous `PENDING_SYNC` offline flagging during server/test runs.
    - Added `timer?.unref?.()` to `sessionService.ts` cleanup interval, ensuring Node.js test runner processes terminate cleanly without hanging the event loop.
    - Added ergonomic aliases `createDraft` and `approveSubmission` in `submissionService.ts`.
  - **Automated Acceptance Test Coverage**:
    - 100% pass across all 31 automated test suites in `run-all-tests.ts`, including the new `phase30-full-integration-security-regression-acceptance.test.ts`.

## [29.0.0-phase29-remember-me-end-to-end-authentication] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 29: Remember Me End-to-End Authentication (`src/services/sessionService.ts`, `src/services/userService.ts`, `server.ts`, `backend/apps/accounts/models.py`, `backend/apps/accounts/views.py`, `backend/apps/accounts/urls.py`, `src/components/LoginPage.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/tests/phase29-remember-me-end-to-end-authentication.test.ts`)**:
  - **Login Form Cleanliness & Unchecked Checkbox Default (Requirements 1, 2)**:
    - Added "Remember Me on this device" checkbox to the login form, unchecked by default.
    - Corporate email and password fields remain completely empty by default with helpful guiding placeholders (`e.g. abebe.kebede@oromiabank.com`, `Enter your institutional password`) and zero pre-filled test credentials.
  - **Existing Architecture Reuse & Server-Controlled Persistent Sessions (Requirements 3, 4)**:
    - Reused existing Django & Node.js session, token, cookie, and audit architecture.
    - Built `sessionService.ts` creating cryptographically secure (256-bit entropy) persistent sessions with SHA-256 token hashing on the server.
    - Raw tokens are never stored in plaintext on the server; client presents token verified against salted hash.
    - Implemented `PersistentSession` model in Django `apps.accounts` with identical schema and lifecycle attributes.
  - **Storage Security & Credential Protection (Requirement 5)**:
    - Plaintext passwords, password hashes, and biometric templates are strictly prevented from ever being stored in `localStorage` or returned in session verification payloads.
    - Only safe user session profiles and opaque session tokens are handled on the client.
  - **Secure HttpOnly / SameSite Cookie Architecture (Requirement 6)**:
    - Issued `ob_remember_token` cookie with `HttpOnly`, `Path=/`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Max-Age=2592000` (30 days), and `Secure` flag in production environments.
    - Dual header support (`Cookie` and `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) ensures seamless operation in iFrame and preview sandbox environments.
  - **Defined Maximum Lifetime & Revocation (Requirement 7)**:
    - Persistent sessions enforce a strict defined maximum lifetime of 30 days (`expiresAt`).
    - Stale or expired sessions (`now > expiresAt`) are immediately rejected with `SESSION_EXPIRED` and purged.
    - Sessions can be individually revoked by session ID or token.
  - **Explicit Logout Invalidation & Silent Restoration Prevention (Requirement 8)**:
    - Explicit portal sign-out triggers `POST /api/auth/logout`, revoking the server session record (`EXPLICIT_LOGOUT`) and clearing the `ob_remember_token` cookie with `Max-Age=0`.
    - Local storage (`ob_logged_in_user`, `ob_remember_me_active`) and session storage (`ob_transient_user`) are wiped.
    - Attempting to restore a session using an old token after logout strictly fails with `SESSION_REVOKED`, guaranteeing the user is never silently restored.
  - **Password Change & Account Disablement Lifecycle Invalidation (Requirement 9)**:
    - Password updates/resets (`userService.resetPassword`) immediately revoke all active persistent sessions for that officer across all devices with reason `PASSWORD_CHANGED`.
    - Disabling an account (`updateUserStatus` to `DISABLED`) immediately revokes all persistent sessions with reason `ACCOUNT_DISABLED` and blocks subsequent restoration attempts.
  - **Biometric Policy Authority Preservation (Requirement 10)**:
    - Remember Me never bypasses the bank's biometric security policy.
    - For officers with enrolled biometric credentials (Fingerprint / Face ID), persistent session restoration evaluates `requiresBiometricVerification: true`, preserving explicit biometric authentication as authoritative.
  - **Multiple Concurrent Sessions Across Devices (Requirement 11)**:
    - Supported multiple independent persistent sessions per user account (e.g. desktop workstation and mobile tablet).
    - Revoking one device's session does not interrupt sessions on other devices.
    - Built `GET /api/auth/sessions` and `POST /api/auth/sessions/revoke` for comprehensive session governance.
  - **Security Anti-Forgery & Extension Defenses (Requirement 12)**:
    - Direct attempts to present forged, forged-entropy, or tampered tokens are rejected with `TOKEN_INVALID` and logged to the regulatory audit log (`TOKEN_FORGERY`).
    - Expiration dates are server-authoritative and cannot be artificially extended by the client.
  - **Automated Acceptance Testing Suite**:
    - Created `src/tests/phase29-remember-me-end-to-end-authentication.test.ts` covering all 12 acceptance criteria, integrated into `run-all-tests.ts`.
    - 100% pass across all 30 application test suites.

## [28.0.0-phase28-logout-confirmation-and-dashboard-responsibility-cleanup] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 28: Logout Confirmation and Dashboard Responsibility Cleanup (`App.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `BottomNavigation.tsx`, `MobileBottomNav.tsx`, `CommandPaletteModal.tsx`, `useSwipeGesture.ts`, `SystemHealthDashboard.tsx`, `Phase2SSOTView.tsx`, `phase28-logout-confirmation-and-dashboard-responsibility-cleanup.test.ts`)**:
  - **Explicit Logout Confirmation Dialog & Cancel Lifecycle (Requirements 1, 2, 3)**:
    - Initiates an explicit confirmation modal upon clicking "Logout" in Navbar, Sidebar (desktop expanded or collapsed), or Mobile Navigation Drawer.
    - Prevents immediate/accidental termination of active banking sessions.
    - Clicking "Cancel" cleanly keeps the session active without interruption.
  - **Pre-Logout Pending Autosave Flush & Safeguards (Requirements 4, 5)**:
    - Before confirmed logout, pending draft changes in active report returns are flushed to the server.
    - If server persistence fails, work is NOT silently discarded; a clear persistence warning is shown with options to "Retry Save & Sign Out" or "Discard & Sign Out".
  - **Authentication Invalidation & Transient Biometric State Purge (Requirement 6)**:
    - On confirmed sign-out, session tokens and sensitive transient biometric state (`ob_internal_hw_diagnostic`, `ob_biometric_challenge`, `ob_face_auth_temp`, `ob_active_session_token`, `ob_auth_history_cache`) are purged from storage.
    - Persisted drafts in local storage, IndexedDB, and server SSOT remain safely preserved.
  - **System Health Removal from Non-Admin Dashboards (Requirements 7, 8)**:
    - Strictly removed System Health from Maker, Checker, and Auditor dashboards, including Sidebar navigation, Command Palette, mobile bottom bars, and swipe gestures.
    - `isTabAuthorized('SYSTEM_HEALTH', role)` returns `true` exclusively for `ADMIN`.
    - `SystemHealthDashboard` guards component execution and suppresses hardware capabilities probes/telemetry polling if non-admin.
    - Preserved System Health telemetry and diagnostic capabilities for Administrator.
  - **SSOT Lakehouse & Medallion Pipeline Removal from Non-Admin Dashboards (Requirements 9, 10)**:
    - Strictly removed the Phase 2 SSOT Lakehouse & Medallion Pipeline from Maker, Checker, and Auditor dashboards, navigation bars, and swipe gestures.
    - `isTabAuthorized('PHASE2_SSOT', role)` returns `true` exclusively for `ADMIN`.
    - `Phase2SSOTView` guards component execution and suppresses `/api/phase2/quality` and `/api/phase2/reconcile` API calls if non-admin.
    - Preserved full SSOT Lakehouse and Medallion pipeline capability for Administrator.
  - **Backend Functionality & Administrative Governance (Requirement 11, 12, 13)**:
    - Preserved backend health and SSOT endpoints for Administrator governance.
    - Unified role-aware dashboard composition without duplicated code.
    - Reclaimed layout space across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen configurations.
  - **Acceptance Testing Suite (Requirement 14)**:
    - Created `src/tests/phase28-logout-confirmation-and-dashboard-responsibility-cleanup.test.ts` with 100% pass across all assertions.
    - Verified full regression test suite across all 28 registered phases.

      - Governed lifecycle disposition: removal impact assessment, regulatory retention warnings, governed archival (`ARCHIVE`) and voiding (`VOID`) preserving historical snapshots and audit trail.
      - Destruction of submitted statutory returns is strictly prohibited; unsubmitted drafts can be purged under administrative authorization.
  - **Effective Access Engine Integration (Requirement 4)**:
    - Extended `effectiveAccessEngine.evaluateSubmissionAccess()` to enforce submission-level permissions across actions: `VIEW`, `CREATE_DRAFT`, `EDIT_DRAFT`, `DELETE_DRAFT`, `REVIEW`, `APPROVE`, `REJECT`, `REQUEST_CORRECTION`, `EXPORT_XLSX`, `AUDIT_INSPECT`, `INSPECT_HISTORY`, `COMMENT`, `FLAG`, `ADMIN_ARCHIVE`, `ADMIN_VOID`.
    - Enforces home department matching, M:N linked departments, direct user report assignments, active special access grants, and account active status.
    - Special access grants dynamically expand access during valid window; expired grants are strictly rejected.
  - **Server-Side Permission Filtering & Protection Against Leakage (Requirement 5 & 10)**:
    - Backend `submissionService.queryLibrary()` filters authorized records before computing counts, statistics, search matching, and pagination.
    - Stats bar (`all`, `draft`, `inProgress`, `returned`, `submitted`, `reusedCopy`, `archived`, `voided`) reflects only authorized records.
    - Keyword search operates strictly within the authorized dataset (zero search leakage across departments).

    - Any changes (create, edit, save, submit, return, reuse, delete) synchronize across the entire application instantly.
  - **5 Canonical Lifecycle States (Requirement 2)**:
    - Built `deriveLibraryLifecycleState()` supporting:
      1. `DRAFT`: Newly created unedited return draft (v1).
      2. `IN_PROGRESS`: Return draft with active revisions saved (v2+).
      3. `RETURNED`: Return sent back by Checker for corrections (`CORRECTION_REQUIRED`).
      4. `SUBMITTED`: Return sealed and submitted to review (`PENDING_CHECKER`), approved, or delivered to NBE (`SENT`).
      5. `REUSED_COPY`: Unsubmitted return created from a prior submitted filing (`reusedFromSubmissionId` preserved).
  - **Maker Save, Reopen, Edit, Validate & Submit Lifecycle (Requirement 3)**:
    - Makers can save unfinished drafts, leave, reopen from Library, continue editing, trigger authoritative rule validation (`validateSubmission`), and submit to Checker queue with preparation notes.
  - **Submitted Report "Reuse as New" Lifecycle (Requirement 4)**:
    - Submitted returns are permanently sealed and cannot be edited in place.
    - "Reuse as New" creates a brand-new report identity (new unique ID, v1, status `DRAFT`), copying verified data structures while preserving `reusedFromSubmissionId` and `reusedFromVersion`.
    - Original source report remains 100% immutable (unmodified hash, values, and status).
  - **Strict Deletion Permissions & Protections (Requirements 5, 6, 9)**:
    - Makers can delete unsubmitted drafts only (`DRAFT`, `CORRECTION_REQUIRED`).
    - Submitted reports (`PENDING_CHECKER`, `APPROVED`, `SENT`) strictly forbid deletion at both UI and backend API level, returning HTTP 403 Forbidden.
    - Every deletion requires an explicit confirmation dialog with Cancel/Delete before removal.
    - Cross-maker and cross-department deletion protection prevents unauthorized draft purging.
  - **Server-Side Permission Filtering & Query Engine (Requirements 7, 10)**:
    - REST endpoint `GET /api/regulatory/library` with server-side authorization: Makers only see authorized returns matching their home department, M:N linked departments, and active special access grants.
    - Comprehensive filtering: keyword search, lifecycle state, raw status, category/report type, reporting frequency, date ranges (`startDate`, `endDate`), and multi-field sorting.
    - Server-side pagination returning `{ items, total, page, pageSize, totalPages, stats }`.
  - **Responsive Dual-Mode UI (Cards & Table) (Requirement 8)**:
    - Grid Cards view with interactive lifecycle pills, version chips, department badges, and quick actions.
    - Compact Table view for data-dense inspection.
    - Real-time loading skeleton, empty state with filter reset, error state, and 403 permission-denied banners.
  - **Persistence & Rehydration (Requirement 11)**:

## [24.0.0-phase24-validation-error-warning-remediation-assistant] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 24: Unified Validation & Remediation Assistant (`remediation.ts`, `validationRemediationService.ts`, `ValidationRemediationAssistant.tsx`, `DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `submissionService.ts`, `server.ts`, `src/tests/phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts`)**:
  - **Authoritative Server-Side Validation Normalization**:
    - Built `ValidationRemediationService` unifying checks across return line items, dynamic repeatable schedules, cross-field regulatory rules, and report definition structures.
    - Normalized output schema with severity (`BLOCKING_ERROR`, `WARNING`), category (`DATA_ERROR`, `REPORT_DEFINITION_ERROR`, `BUSINESS_RULE_ERROR`), path, fieldCode, fieldTitle, ruleSource, suggestedAction, and deterministic `proposedFix`.
  - **4-Part Understandable Explanations**:
    - Every error and warning provides a clear 4-part narrative:
      1. `WHAT IS WRONG`: Concrete statement of invalid condition or missing input.
      2. `WHY IT MATTERS`: Regulatory and supervisory consequence citing NBE Directive BSD/03/2020.
      3. `HOW TO FIX IT`: Actionable step-by-step guidance for the officer.
      4. `EXPECTED FORMAT`: Exact numeric, date, percentage, or text syntax required.
  - **Interactive Locate & Focus Field Navigation**:
    - Clicking "Locate" navigates to the item across tabs (`ITEMS` vs `DYNAMIC_SCHEDULES`), resets filters, switches pagination page, scrolls element into center viewport, focuses input, and temporarily pulses high-contrast amber highlight ring (`ring-2 ring-amber-500 animate-pulse`).
  - **Safe Deterministic Auto-Fix Capability**:
    - Deterministic corrections only: numeric formatting/comma cleanup, ETB currency 2-decimal precision rounding per NBE rules, ISO-8601 date normalization (`YYYY/MM/DD` -> `YYYY-MM-DD`, whitespace trimming), and formula total synchronization (`FormulaEngine.calculateReport`).
  - **Strict Anti-Guessing Safety Guarantee**:
    - Ambiguous business values (missing mandatory amounts, negative capital/asset balances, out-of-range percentage ratios, headcount counts, unparseable date strings, cross-field accounting imbalances) are strictly marked `autoFixable: false` and never automatically guessed.
  - **CURRENT → PROPOSED Review Confirmation Modal**:
    - Non-trivial fixes display interactive comparison modal showing Current Value, Proposed Value, Reason, and Rule Source before applying.
  - **Authoritative Revalidation & Save Lifecycle**:
    - Auto-fix persists updated draft, increments version, runs authoritative recalculation, and reruns normalization; issues are cleared from the summary only when genuinely resolved.
  - **DATA ERROR vs REPORT-DEFINITION / RULE ERROR Segregation**:
    - Distinguishes user input mistakes from template definition issues (e.g. duplicate field codes or circular references), displaying guidance that only authorized configuration users (`ADMIN`) can modify templates in Report Template Studio.
  - **Audit Logging with Sensitive Value Redaction**:
    - Recorded `VALIDATION_REMEDIATION_APPLIED` audit events with actor, submission ID, field, fix type, and timestamp, while completely redacting multi-million financial figures (`[REDACTED_FINANCIAL_VALUE_PROTECTED]`).
  - **Pre-Submission Blocking Gate Enforcement**:
    - Server-side and client-side gates prevent transition to `PENDING_CHECKER` while blocking errors remain.
  - **Automated Acceptance Test Coverage**:
    - 100% pass across all 12 test sections and 60+ assertions in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts`.

## [23.1.0-phase23-maker-draft-edit-save-resubmit-lifecycle] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 23: Maker Draft/Edit/Save/Resubmit & Reuse Lifecycle (`submissionService.ts`, `DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `MakerWorkspace.tsx`, `server.ts`, `src/types/regulatory.ts`, `src/tests/phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts`)**:
  - **Complete Primary Lifecycle (`CREATE → EDIT → SAVE DRAFT → LEAVE → RETURN → CONTINUE → VALIDATE → SUBMIT`)**:
    - **Draft Creation**: Authorized Makers create report drafts initialized at v1 with cryptographic integrity seals and immutable `CREATE_DRAFT` audit records.
    - **Persistent Edit & Save**: Edits update values and dynamic schedules, auto-calculate formulas, increment version, and persist to backend and IndexedDB with `UPDATE_DRAFT` audit tracking.
    - **Leave & Return Safety**: Maker can safely leave the form; uncommitted changes are auto-persisted to prevent data loss. Returning to the workspace seamlessly reopens the exact persisted draft version with all input values preserved.
    - **Validation & Submit**: Real-time Zod and ValidationEngine checks gate submission to Checker (`PENDING_CHECKER`), capturing an immutable historical snapshot.
  - **Returned for Correction & Resubmission Lifecycle (`CORRECTION_REQUIRED → EDIT & CORRECT → RESUBMIT`)**:
    - When a Checker reviews and requests corrections, report transitions to `CORRECTION_REQUIRED` with supervisory notes attached.
    - Maker reopens returned report, updates values and dynamic schedules, validates, and resubmits to Checker with `RESUBMIT_TO_CHECKER` audit logging.
  - **Submitted Report Immutability & "Reuse as New" Lifecycle (`SUBMITTED REPORT → REUSE AS NEW → NEW DRAFT → MODIFY → SAVE → SUBMIT`)**:
    - **Strict In-Place Mutation Prevention**: Direct edit attempts on submitted/final reports (`SENT`, `APPROVED`, `SENDING`) are strictly blocked with descriptive errors; submitted reports are permanently sealed.
    - **Reuse as New Mechanism**: Maker invokes `reuseSubmission(id, user)` which creates a brand-new report identity (status `DRAFT`, version 1) pre-populated with baseline values and dynamic rows, while linking `reusedFromSubmissionId` and `reusedFromVersion`.
    - **Source Preservation Invariant**: Verified that source report values, integrity hash, and status remain 100% untouched and unchanged.
    - **Full Workflow Support**: The new reused report is completely editable, saveable, validatable, and submittable as a new regulatory return.
  - **Optimistic Concurrency & Multi-Tab Conflict Locking**:
    - Enforced `expectedVersion` checking on `updateDraft` and `submitToChecker`; concurrent tab conflicts throw `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION_CONFLICT` (HTTP 409 Conflict) preventing silent overwriting of edits.
  - **Automated Acceptance Test Coverage**:
    - 100% passing across all 6 test suites in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts`.

    - Server-authoritative quality and liveness enforcement (`/api/auth/biometrics/face/enroll`): validates single face, luminance in [35, 235], sharpness >= 0.35, spoof probability <= 0.40.
    - Protected template persistence: non-invertible salted HMAC feature signature (`computeProtectedFaceSignature`); zero raw camera frames or pixel buffers stored.
    - Graceful error notifications and recovery actions for: permission granted/denied/dismissed, no camera (`NotFoundError`), camera busy (`NotReadableError`), unsupported browser, initialization failure, no face (`faceCount === 0`), multiple faces (`faceCount > 1`), poor quality (blurry, underexposed, overexposed glare), timeout (30-second inactivity auto-cancel), liveness failure, and server failure.
    - Truthful hardware identity: does not claim exact device model unless the browser reliably provides it via `MediaDeviceInfo.label`.
  - WebAuthn Platform Fingerprint Passkey Enrollment:
    - Authenticated identity context binding: only active authorized institutional accounts can obtain challenges and register passkeys.
    - Cryptographic server challenge issuance (`/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/register-options`) with 60-second TTL.
    - Standard `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` with `platform` authenticator attachment and `userVerification: required`.
    - Server verification endpoint (`/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/register-verify`) with credential ID storage, monotonic counter initialization, and public-key metadata.

## [8.0.0-phase8-configuration-governance-versioning-rollback] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Configuration Governance & Versioning Engine (`src/services/configurationGovernanceService.ts`, `08_CONFIGURATION_GOVERNANCE_VERSIONING_ROLLBACK.md`)**:
  - Full controlled lifecycle: `Draft → Validate → Impact Analysis → Dual Review/Approval → Publish → Effective → Audit`.
  - Four-tier risk classification engine:
    - `CRITICAL`: Role permissions, RBAC authorization, statutory return deletion.
    - `HIGH`: Mathematical formula alteration, field deletion, department restructuring, workflow alteration, and rollbacks.
    - `MEDIUM`: Description updates, optional field additions, non-critical assignments.
    - `LOW`: Cosmetic notes, display order adjustments. Auto-approval permitted.
  - Multi-domain impact analysis identifying affected:
    - Users (by report duty, department membership, and compliance supervisory responsibilities).
    - Departments (primary owners and contributing linked departments).
    - Reports (return keys, frequencies, formulas, and dependent schedules).
    - Workflows (submission review steps and role requirements).
    - Permissions (modified roles and authorization matrix).
    - Active and historical submissions (drafts, pending review, approved, sent), with explicit non-repudiation guarantees.
  - Credential and secret sanitization (`sanitizeGovernanceState`): Deep recursive scrubbing of passwords, tokens, API keys, hashes, and PINs to `[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]` in all before/after states.
  - Segregation of duties & 4-eyes rule enforcement:
    - Strict prohibition: Proposer cannot approve their own high-impact configuration proposal (`SEGREGATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION`).
    - Review restricted strictly to authorized `ADMIN` or `CHECKER` roles (`UNAUTHORIZED_APPROVAL`).
  - Optimistic concurrency locking & collision prevention:
    - Automatic version tracking (`expectedEntityVersion` and config hash) prevents administrators from silently overwriting each other's changes (`CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT`, HTTP 409).
  - Controlled governed rollback:
    - A rollback is a new auditable change; past versions and historical submissions are NEVER rewritten or lost.
    - Rollback creates a new version snapshot (Version N+1) reproducing the target historical schema.
  - Material change user notifications:
    - Users affected by material configuration changes receive targeted notifications detailing risk level, effective date, and impact rationale.
  - Phase 8 Completion Gate: Official audit explanation engine (`explainChange`):
    - Explains who changed what, when, from what, to what, under which approval/workflow, when it became effective, and what it affected.
- **Native ConfigService Rollback Integration (`src/services/configService.ts`)**:
  - `rollbackReportVersion(returnKey, targetVersionNumber, actor, reason)` safely recreates target schema as Version N+1 with permanent audit recording.
- **Frontend Governance Component (`src/components/ConfigurationGovernanceView.tsx`)**:
  - Rich split-pane workspace with proposal search, multi-level filters, 7-step visual lifecycle stepper, dependency impact cards, sanitized before/after diff table, 4-eyes review approval modal, rejection dialog, rollback modal with version picker, and the official "Explain Change" inspection modal.
  - Embedded into `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` under the **Governance & Versioning** tab.
  - Embedded into `src/components/ChangeHistoryView.tsx` with a top view-mode selector (**Governed Proposals & Approvals**).
- **Server REST API Endpoints (`server.ts`)**:
  - `/api/governance/proposals` (GET, POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id` (GET)

  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/approve` (POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/reject` (POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/publish` (POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/rollback` (POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/explain` (GET)
  - `/api/governance/notifications` (GET)
  - `/api/governance/notifications/:id/read` (POST)
- **Comprehensive Automated Test Suite (`src/tests/configuration-governance-versioning.test.ts`)**:
  - 11 test sections (57 assertions, 100% pass) verifying secret sanitization, risk classification, impact analysis, structural validation, segregation of duties, optimistic concurrency collisions, publication, rejection, rollback, and the official audit explanation completion gate.

## [7.0.0-phase7-real-time-ssot-synchronization] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Authoritative Real-Time SSOT Engine (`src/services/realtimeSsotEngine.ts`, `server.ts`, `07_REAL_TIME_SSOT_SYNCHRONIZATION.md`)**:
  - WebSocket (`/ws/ssot`) + SSE (`/api/config/events`) real-time communication pipeline strictly anchored to Django/database SSOT authority.
  - Zero simulated timers or synthetic pollers; state changes propagate purely on committed transactional mutations.
  - Monotonic event sequence counter (`sequenceNumber`) and UUID generation (`eventId`) with 1,000-event circular replay buffer.
  - Comprehensive event taxonomy: `USER_CHANGED`, `DEPARTMENT_CHANGED`, `REPORT_CHANGED`, `ASSIGNMENT_CHANGED`, `SPECIAL_ACCESS_CHANGED`, `WORKFLOW_STATUS_CHANGED`, `CONFIG_SYNC_TRIGGER`.
  - Sensitive credential scrubbing: Automatic removal of `password`, `passwordHash`, `token`, and auth headers from event payloads.
  - Fine-grained topic subscription authorization (RBAC):
    - `ADMIN:CONFIG` & `ADMIN:USERS`: Strict Admin-only access.
    - `USER:<id>`: Strict individual officer isolation.
    - `DEPT:<id>`: Department members and authorized multi-department delegates.
    - `AUDIT:EVENTS`: Auditor and Admin inspection feed.
    - `GLOBAL` & `REPORTS`: Authenticated bank officer broad catalog updates.
- **Client Synchronization Service (`src/services/realtimeSsotClient.ts`)**:
  - Dual WebSocket + SSE failover transport.
  - Connection lifecycle management: Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (`1s` to `30s`) and random jitter, heartbeat keep-alive (`30s`), and connection state broadcasting.
  - Reconnect gap recovery: Transmits `SYNC_REQUEST` on connect; replays missed events or issues `REVALIDATE_ALL` if gap exceeds buffer.
  - Message deduplication: 1,000-entry LRU cache to eliminate duplicate event handling.
- **Surgical React State Invalidation Hook (`src/hooks/useRealtimeSSOT.ts`)**:
  - Domain-specific invalidation listeners preserving mounted React component state and active user input in draft forms.

## [6.0.0-phase6-safe-bulk-operations-import-export-and-file-workflows] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Authoritative Bulk Operations Engine (`src/services/bulkOperationsEngine.ts`, `06_BULK_OPERATIONS_IMPORT_EXPORT.md`)**:
  - Full transactional, auditable bulk management engine across Users, Departments, Reports, Submissions, and Special Access Grants.
  - **Mandatory Workflow**: `Select/upload → parse → validate → detect conflicts → preview → explicit confirmation → transactional execution → audit → result report`.
  - **Zero-Mutation Dry-Run Guarantee**: File uploads and parsing generate structured preview dry runs (`dryRunId`) with 15-minute TTL without mutating any underlying database or state.
  - **Conflict Strategies**: Configurable resolution modes: `UPDATE` (merge/update existing), `SKIP` (preserve existing, create new only), and `FAIL_ON_CONFLICT` (strictly reject batches containing duplicate identifiers).
  - **Deep Data Validation**: Required column checks, type validations, RFC 5322 email formatting, unique employee IDs and department short codes, valid organizational units, and batch-level duplicate detection.
  - **Atomic Transaction & Snapshot Rollback**: Pre-execution snapshots captured prior to mutations. If any row encounters an error in `ATOMIC` mode, the entire batch automatically reverts to the pristine snapshot and seals a `BULK_OPERATION_ROLLBACK` event in the audit trail.
  - **Partial Success Mode**: `PARTIAL` mode applies valid rows while recording exact row-level failures with actionable remediation notes.
  - **Formula Injection (CSV Injection / CWE-1236) Protection**: Neutralizes dynamic formula/DDE execution payloads starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r` by automatically prefixing single quotes on exports and parsed inputs.
  - **Oversized & Malicious File Protection**: Hard 5,000 row limits, payload sanitization, path traversal defense, and format enforcement (`CSV`, `JSON`, `XLSX`).
  - **Zero-Bypass Authorization & Privilege Escalation Checks**: Non-admins (Makers, Checkers, Auditors) are strictly barred from performing user/department bulk administration (`HTTP 403`). Protection prevents unauthorized promotion to `ADMIN` and prevents demotion or deactivation of the primary compliance administrator (`usr_admin_1`).
  - **Authorized Exports with Immutable Auditing**: Role- and department-filtered exports for Users, Departments, Reports, and Submissions in CSV, JSON, and XLSX formats with comprehensive audit logging.
- **Enterprise Bulk Operations Modal (`src/components/BulkOperationsModal.tsx`)**:
  - 4-step wizard interface: (1) Configure & Upload, (2) Validate & Preview with metric cards and paginated row-diff inspection, (3) Explicit Confirmation with legal/regulatory checkbox, and (4) Transactional Execution with full outcome breakdown.
- **Admin Dashboard Integration (`src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`)**:
  - Multi-select row checkboxes with "Select All Visible" header checkbox.

  - Top action toolbar button: "Bulk Import & Ops" and direct export buttons.
- **Department & Report Studio Integration (`src/components/DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`)**:
  - Upgraded Bulk Import to the transactional `BulkOperationsModal`.
- **Server REST API Endpoints (`server.ts`)**:
  - `POST /api/bulk/dry-run`: Dry-run validation preview.
  - `GET /api/bulk/dry-run/:dryRunId`: Retrieve cached dry-run with custom pagination.
  - `POST /api/bulk/execute`: Explicit transactional execution with mode and confirmation.
  - `POST /api/bulk/users/action`: Multi-select user actions (activate, deactivate, department, role, report assignment, special access).
  - `POST /api/bulk/reports/action`: Bulk report actions (retirement, activation, department linkage).
  - `POST /api/bulk/export`: Authorized and audited CSV/JSON/XLSX export.
- **Comprehensive Automated Test Suite (`src/tests/phase6-bulk-operations.test.ts`)**:
  - 12-section test coverage: formula injection, zero-mutation dry-run, explicit confirmation, conflict strategies (UPDATE, SKIP, FAIL), invalid data rejection, privilege escalation and root admin protection, atomic transaction rollback to pristine state, partial success mode, bulk multi-select user operations, report retirement preservation, authorized exports, and large dataset pagination (100% pass).

  - Draft state: Working drafts can be saved and edited iteratively without affecting active reporting.
  - Validation: Structural integrity, unique field codes, formula dependencies, and cycle detection.
  - Preview: Live schema conversion to `ReportMetadata` preview format for inspection before publishing.
  - Authoritative publishing: Transitions the target version to `ACTIVE`, supersedes the previous active version with an `effectiveTo` timestamp, and immediately syncs the active regulatory catalog.
  - Safe retirement: Marks obsolete returns as `RETIRED` with statutory reasoning, archiving them while preserving past submissions for audit.

- **Phase 5 Automated End-to-End Verification Test Suite (`src/tests/phase5-final-verification.test.ts`)**:
  - Implemented automated verification of all 14 mandatory end-to-end flows:
    1. Admin Login & Dashboard Routing
    2. Maker Login & Workspace Routing
    3. Checker Login & Inbox Routing
    4. Auditor Login & Independent Dashboard Routing
    5. User Registration & Admin Approval Flow
    6. Password Authentication & Zero-Bypass Checks
    7. Biometric Passkey (WebAuthn) & Optical Face ID Enrollment
    8. Biometric Authentication & Verification (distinguishing Code Verified from physical hardware unavailability in headless CI)
    9. Complete Maker Reporting Lifecycle (Create -> Save -> Edit -> Submit)
    10. Complete Checker Review Lifecycle (Review -> Request Correction -> Re-review -> Approve)
    11. Auditor Independent Inspection Lifecycle (Work Queue -> Findings -> Evidence -> Remediations -> Working Notes -> Audit Package)
    12. Central Bank Transmission to NBE Gateway (Receipt number, delivery timestamp, idempotency)
    13. User Session Logout Flow & Audit Trail Attribution
    14. Deliberate Unauthorized Access Attempts (Maker self-approval blocked, Checker NBE delivery blocked, Cross-department submission blocked)
- **Unified Full-Stack Test Command (`npm run test:all`)**:
  - Chains TypeScript/React unit & integration tests (`npm test`), Django backend app tests (`npm run test:backend`), and NBE simulator microservice tests (`npm run test:simulator`).
- **Python Dependencies in Backend Requirements (`backend/requirements.txt`)**:

### Verified
- **Architectural & Security Integrity**:
  - Multi-tier architecture: React SPA -> Node/Express Proxy -> Django Core Services -> SQLite DB -> NBE Gateway Service -> NBE Simulator Daemon.
  - Zero-bypass authorization: Operational actions (create, edit, approve, deliver) rejected by backend when attempted by unauthorized roles or across department boundaries.
  - 4-Eyes principle enforced both client-side and server-side.
- **Completion Gates**:
  - All 12 completion gates evaluated and certified **PASS**.

- **Footer Whitespace Discipline (`src/components/LoginPage.tsx`, `src/components/RegisterPage.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`)**:
  - Removed unnecessary vertical empty space beneath "All rights reserved." on login and registration pages.
  - Replaced `min-h-screen min-h-[100dvh]` with pure `min-h-[100dvh]` and normalized footer padding (`py-2.5 sm:py-3`), preventing mobile address-bar height expansion.
  - Removed redundant mobile `pb-20` on `<main>` in `App.tsx` (reduced to `pb-3 sm:pb-4`), eliminating empty gaps above `BottomNavigation`.
- **Desktop Sidebar Height Protection (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)**:
  - Added `max-h-[50vh] overflow-y-auto` to the bottom actions container of the desktop sidebar, preventing clipping on short desktop or tablet landscape viewports (e.g. 1024x768 or 600px height).
  - Enforced $\ge 44$px touch targets on both expanded and collapsed Logout buttons.
- **Color Standardization Cleanups**:
  - Standardized remaining dark hex palettes in `DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `BiometricPromptModal.tsx`, `UserSettingsModal.tsx`, `BulkImportModal.tsx`, and `BiometricRecoveryModal.tsx` to shared tokens.
