## [25.0.0-phase25-library-core-architecture-and-maker-library] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 25: Library Core Architecture & Maker Library (`MakerLibraryView.tsx`, `submissionService.ts`, `regulatory.ts`, `server.ts`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `MakerWorkspace.tsx`, `BottomNavigation.tsx`, `MobileBottomNav.tsx`, `CommandPaletteModal.tsx`, `KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx`, `phase25-library-core-architecture-maker-library.test.ts`)**:
  - **First-Class "Library" Sidebar Feature & Hotkey (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`)**:
    - Introduced a primary `LIBRARY` navigation view and sidebar entry with `BookOpen` icon, accessible to Makers, Checkers, Auditors, and Admins.
    - Integrated into Sidebar, Command Palette, Keyboard Shortcuts cheat sheet, and mobile thumb-navigation bars.
  - **Authoritative Single-Source-of-Truth Architecture (Requirement 1)**:
    - Library queries live records from `submissionService` and historical snapshots (`SubmissionSnapshot`), eliminating disconnected duplicate databases.
    - Any changes (create, edit, save, submit, return, reuse, delete) synchronize across the entire application instantly.
  - **5 Canonical Lifecycle States (Requirement 2)**:
    - Built `deriveLibraryLifecycleState()` supporting:
      1. `DRAFT`: Newly created unedited return draft (v1).
      2. `IN_PROGRESS`: Return draft with active revisions saved (v2+).
      3. `RETURNED`: Return sent back by Checker for corrections (`CORRECTION_REQUIRED`).
      4. `SUBMITTED`: Return sealed and submitted to review (`PENDING_CHECKER`), approved, or delivered to NBE (`SENT`).
      5. `REUSED_COPY`: Unsubmitted return created from a prior submitted filing (`reusedFromSubmissionId` preserved).
  - **Maker Save, Reopen, Edit, Validate & Submit Lifecycle (Requirement 3)**:
    - Makers can save unfinished drafts, leave, reopen from Library, continue editing, trigger authoritative rule validation (`validateSubmission`), and submit to Checker queue with preparation notes.
  - **Submitted Report "Reuse as New" Lifecycle (Requirement 4)**:
    - Submitted returns are permanently sealed and cannot be edited in place.
    - "Reuse as New" creates a brand-new report identity (new unique ID, v1, status `DRAFT`), copying verified data structures while preserving `reusedFromSubmissionId` and `reusedFromVersion`.
    - Original source report remains 100% immutable (unmodified hash, values, and status).
  - **Strict Deletion Permissions & Protections (Requirements 5, 6, 9)**:
    - Makers can delete unsubmitted drafts only (`DRAFT`, `CORRECTION_REQUIRED`).
    - Submitted reports (`PENDING_CHECKER`, `APPROVED`, `SENT`) strictly forbid deletion at both UI and backend API level, returning HTTP 403 Forbidden.
    - Every deletion requires an explicit confirmation dialog with Cancel/Delete before removal.
    - Cross-maker and cross-department deletion protection prevents unauthorized draft purging.
  - **Server-Side Permission Filtering & Query Engine (Requirements 7, 10)**:
    - REST endpoint `GET /api/regulatory/library` with server-side authorization: Makers only see authorized returns matching their home department, M:N linked departments, and active special access grants.
    - Comprehensive filtering: keyword search, lifecycle state, raw status, category/report type, reporting frequency, date ranges (`startDate`, `endDate`), and multi-field sorting.
    - Server-side pagination returning `{ items, total, page, pageSize, totalPages, stats }`.
  - **Responsive Dual-Mode UI (Cards & Table) (Requirement 8)**:
    - Grid Cards view with interactive lifecycle pills, version chips, department badges, and quick actions.
    - Compact Table view for data-dense inspection.
    - Real-time loading skeleton, empty state with filter reset, error state, and 403 permission-denied banners.
  - **Persistence & Rehydration (Requirement 11)**:
    - Library data persists to IndexedDB and rehydrates seamlessly upon page refresh, login/logout, or browser restart.
  - **Automated Acceptance Test Coverage (Requirement 13)**:
    - 100% pass across all 7 test sections and 35+ assertions in `phase25-library-core-architecture-maker-library.test.ts`.

## [24.0.0-phase24-validation-error-warning-remediation-assistant] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 24: Unified Validation & Remediation Assistant (`remediation.ts`, `validationRemediationService.ts`, `ValidationRemediationAssistant.tsx`, `DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `submissionService.ts`, `server.ts`, `src/tests/phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts`)**:
  - **Authoritative Server-Side Validation Normalization**:
    - Built `ValidationRemediationService` unifying checks across return line items, dynamic repeatable schedules, cross-field regulatory rules, and report definition structures.
    - Normalized output schema with severity (`BLOCKING_ERROR`, `WARNING`), category (`DATA_ERROR`, `REPORT_DEFINITION_ERROR`, `BUSINESS_RULE_ERROR`), path, fieldCode, fieldTitle, ruleSource, suggestedAction, and deterministic `proposedFix`.
  - **4-Part Understandable Explanations**:
    - Every error and warning provides a clear 4-part narrative:
      1. `WHAT IS WRONG`: Concrete statement of invalid condition or missing input.
      2. `WHY IT MATTERS`: Regulatory and supervisory consequence citing NBE Directive BSD/03/2020.
      3. `HOW TO FIX IT`: Actionable step-by-step guidance for the officer.
      4. `EXPECTED FORMAT`: Exact numeric, date, percentage, or text syntax required.
  - **Interactive Locate & Focus Field Navigation**:
    - Clicking "Locate" navigates to the item across tabs (`ITEMS` vs `DYNAMIC_SCHEDULES`), resets filters, switches pagination page, scrolls element into center viewport, focuses input, and temporarily pulses high-contrast amber highlight ring (`ring-2 ring-amber-500 animate-pulse`).
  - **Safe Deterministic Auto-Fix Capability**:
    - Deterministic corrections only: numeric formatting/comma cleanup, ETB currency 2-decimal precision rounding per NBE rules, ISO-8601 date normalization (`YYYY/MM/DD` -> `YYYY-MM-DD`, whitespace trimming), and formula total synchronization (`FormulaEngine.calculateReport`).
  - **Strict Anti-Guessing Safety Guarantee**:
    - Ambiguous business values (missing mandatory amounts, negative capital/asset balances, out-of-range percentage ratios, headcount counts, unparseable date strings, cross-field accounting imbalances) are strictly marked `autoFixable: false` and never automatically guessed.
  - **CURRENT → PROPOSED Review Confirmation Modal**:
    - Non-trivial fixes display interactive comparison modal showing Current Value, Proposed Value, Reason, and Rule Source before applying.
  - **Authoritative Revalidation & Save Lifecycle**:
    - Auto-fix persists updated draft, increments version, runs authoritative recalculation, and reruns normalization; issues are cleared from the summary only when genuinely resolved.
  - **DATA ERROR vs REPORT-DEFINITION / RULE ERROR Segregation**:
    - Distinguishes user input mistakes from template definition issues (e.g. duplicate field codes or circular references), displaying guidance that only authorized configuration users (`ADMIN`) can modify templates in Report Template Studio.
  - **Audit Logging with Sensitive Value Redaction**:
    - Recorded `VALIDATION_REMEDIATION_APPLIED` audit events with actor, submission ID, field, fix type, and timestamp, while completely redacting multi-million financial figures (`[REDACTED_FINANCIAL_VALUE_PROTECTED]`).
  - **Pre-Submission Blocking Gate Enforcement**:
    - Server-side and client-side gates prevent transition to `PENDING_CHECKER` while blocking errors remain.
  - **Automated Acceptance Test Coverage**:
    - 100% pass across all 12 test sections and 60+ assertions in `phase24-validation-remediation-assistant.test.ts`.

## [23.1.0-phase23-maker-draft-edit-save-resubmit-lifecycle] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 23: Maker Draft/Edit/Save/Resubmit & Reuse Lifecycle (`submissionService.ts`, `DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `MakerWorkspace.tsx`, `server.ts`, `src/types/regulatory.ts`, `src/tests/phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts`)**:
  - **Complete Primary Lifecycle (`CREATE → EDIT → SAVE DRAFT → LEAVE → RETURN → CONTINUE → VALIDATE → SUBMIT`)**:
    - **Draft Creation**: Authorized Makers create report drafts initialized at v1 with cryptographic integrity seals and immutable `CREATE_DRAFT` audit records.
    - **Persistent Edit & Save**: Edits update values and dynamic schedules, auto-calculate formulas, increment version, and persist to backend and IndexedDB with `UPDATE_DRAFT` audit tracking.
    - **Leave & Return Safety**: Maker can safely leave the form; uncommitted changes are auto-persisted to prevent data loss. Returning to the workspace seamlessly reopens the exact persisted draft version with all input values preserved.
    - **Validation & Submit**: Real-time Zod and ValidationEngine checks gate submission to Checker (`PENDING_CHECKER`), capturing an immutable historical snapshot.
  - **Returned for Correction & Resubmission Lifecycle (`CORRECTION_REQUIRED → EDIT & CORRECT → RESUBMIT`)**:
    - When a Checker reviews and requests corrections, report transitions to `CORRECTION_REQUIRED` with supervisory notes attached.
    - Maker reopens returned report, updates values and dynamic schedules, validates, and resubmits to Checker with `RESUBMIT_TO_CHECKER` audit logging.
  - **Submitted Report Immutability & "Reuse as New" Lifecycle (`SUBMITTED REPORT → REUSE AS NEW → NEW DRAFT → MODIFY → SAVE → SUBMIT`)**:
    - **Strict In-Place Mutation Prevention**: Direct edit attempts on submitted/final reports (`SENT`, `APPROVED`, `SENDING`) are strictly blocked with descriptive errors; submitted reports are permanently sealed.
    - **Reuse as New Mechanism**: Maker invokes `reuseSubmission(id, user)` which creates a brand-new report identity (status `DRAFT`, version 1) pre-populated with baseline values and dynamic rows, while linking `reusedFromSubmissionId` and `reusedFromVersion`.
    - **Source Preservation Invariant**: Verified that source report values, integrity hash, and status remain 100% untouched and unchanged.
    - **Full Workflow Support**: The new reused report is completely editable, saveable, validatable, and submittable as a new regulatory return.
  - **Optimistic Concurrency & Multi-Tab Conflict Locking**:
    - Enforced `expectedVersion` checking on `updateDraft` and `submitToChecker`; concurrent tab conflicts throw `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION_CONFLICT` (HTTP 409 Conflict) preventing silent overwriting of edits.
  - **Automated Acceptance Test Coverage**:
    - 100% passing across all 6 test suites in `phase23-maker-draft-lifecycle.test.ts`.

## [23.0.0-phase21-22-23-dynamic-report-form-validation-xlsx-autosave] - 2026-10-02

### Added & Enhanced
- **Phase 21: Real-Time Field-Level Validation Logic (`DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `ValidationEngine.ts`, `DynamicAreaTable.tsx`, `src/tests/phase21-realtime-field-level-validation.test.ts`)**:
  - **Currency & Precision Constraints**: Enforced 2 decimal place maximum precision on ETB currency amounts; rejected invalid formatting and non-numeric characters; enforced non-negative balance constraints for Capital, Cash, Deposit, Collateral, and Statutory Reserve accounts.
  - **Ratio & Range Constraints**: Enforced percentage ratio range bounds (0.00% to 100.00%) with explicit range errors/warnings; enforced non-negative whole integer constraints for customer, borrower, and staff counts.
  - **Mandatory Field Constraints**: Flagged missing required fields in real-time with descriptive regulatory warnings; rendered green `Mandatory field compliant` badges for valid inputs.
  - **Dynamic Schedule Validation**: Propagated validation engine summaries to `DynamicAreaTable` displaying cell-level error outlines and alert tooltips across both desktop table and mobile card views.
  - **Interactive Pre-Submission Gate**: Disabled `Submit to Checker` action with diagnostic counter and tooltips while validation errors remain; added interactive validation alert banner with 1-click error filtering (`ERRORS_ONLY`).
  - **Automated Test Coverage**: 100% passing across all 18 assertions in `phase21-realtime-field-level-validation.test.ts`.

- **Phase 22: SheetJS .xlsx Export for NBE-Compliant Offline Review (`DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `regulatoryReportXlsxExport.ts`, `excelService.ts`, `src/tests/phase22-xlsx-sheetjs-export.test.ts`)**:
  - **NBE Multi-Sheet Workbook Generation**: Created 5-sheet statutory workbook using SheetJS (`xlsx`):
    1. `Submission Summary`: Institutional identifiers (Oromia Bank S.C., InstCode `0000013`), return metadata, Maker & Checker 4-eyes audit trail, SHA-256 integrity seal, and Directive BSD/03/2020 citation.
    2. `Return Items`: Fixed line items with Excel number formats (`#,##0.00`), calculation method indicators (Auto/Total/Direct Input), and validation status.
    3. `Dynamic Schedules`: Dedicated worksheets for each dynamic area preserving borrower facilities and asset rosters.
    4. `Validation Checklist`: Comprehensive compliance audit checklist evaluating all NBE consistency rules.
    5. `Offline Review Sign-off`: Institutional examination record with signature lines for NBE Bank Supervision Directorate examiners and Bank Compliance Officers.
  - **Resilient Binary Download**: Implemented Blob + `URL.createObjectURL` anchor download with graceful fallback to `XLSX.writeFile`; displayed real-time success toast with the standardized filename (`OB_NBE_${cleanKey}_FY${FinYear}_${Status}_${SubmissionId}.xlsx`).
  - **Automated Test Coverage**: 100% passing in `phase22-xlsx-sheetjs-export.test.ts` (roundtrip binary parse and integrity verification).

- **Phase 23: Periodic 30-Second IndexedDB Auto-Save (`DynamicReportForm.tsx`, `indexedDbStorage.ts`, `src/tests/phase23-indexeddb-autosave.test.ts`)**:
  - **30-Second Interval Auto-Save**: Configured non-blocking timer in `DynamicReportForm` that automatically persists draft state to IndexedDB every 30 seconds when uncommitted Maker changes exist (`hasUnsavedChanges === true`).
  - **Redundant Write Prevention**: Avoided unnecessary writes when form is clean or in read-only/auditor inspection mode.
  - **Offline Durability & Mount Recovery**: Cached drafts in `indexedDbStorage` with `LOCAL_DRAFT` sync status and `offlineSavedAt` timestamp; automatically detected and restored newer offline drafts upon form mounting.
  - **Live UI Telemetry**: Added dynamic header badge with rotating save spinner, last auto-saved timestamp (`Auto-saved at HH:MM:SS`), and live countdown (`in Ns`).
  - **Automated Test Coverage**: 100% passing in `phase23-indexeddb-autosave.test.ts` (write verification, cadence simulation, and recovery).

  - **Server-Authorized Face ID Reset**:
    - Mandatory step-up password re-authentication before issuing reset authorization.
    - Verification of existing enrollment state prior to reset.
    - Explicit explanation of permanent consequences returned to user (invalidation of face vector template, cached authorization purge, required live optical re-scan).
    - Single-use, short-lived (5 min TTL) cryptographic nonce tokens (`rst_*`).
    - Atomic token consumption defending against replay and race conditions.
    - Permanent template revocation and state transition back to `NOT_ENROLLED`, cleanly allowing fresh optical re-enrollment.
  - **WebAuthn Credential Management & Multi-Authenticator Support**:
    - Architectural support for registering and managing multiple hardware passkeys on a single institutional account (e.g. Work MacBook Touch ID, YubiKey 5C NFC, mobile passkey).

  - Independent & Coexistent Authentication Mechanisms:
    - User selection strictly governs the executed mechanism: Password triggers password authentication, Fingerprint triggers WebAuthn assertion, Face ID triggers optical quality/liveness verification and server matching.
    - Zero silent invocation or automatic silent fallback: biometric failure prompts active user choice (retry, switch method, or input password).
  - Fingerprint / WebAuthn Authentication Engine:
    - Secure challenge lifecycle with 60-second TTL and atomic single-use consumption.
    - Assertion verification (`verifyWebAuthnAssertion` & `/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/auth-verify`) validating credential ownership, RP ID, user binding, and signature assertion.
    - Replay attack defenses: consumed challenges rejected immediately with audit logging; monotonic signature counters strictly enforced, rejecting counter duplicate or rollback anomalies.
    - Comprehensive error handling for unsupported browser, no credential, user cancellation (`AbortError`), timeout, invalid assertion, suspended credential, revoked credential, and server errors.
  - Optical Face ID Authentication Engine:
    - Explicit camera consent and live video stream initialization.
    - Client-side pre-flight checks: luminance, sharpness, single-face validation.
    - Server-authoritative matching (`verifyFaceBiometric` & `/api/auth/biometrics/face/verify`): bounded thresholds for luminance ([35, 235]), sharpness (>= 0.35), single face (`faceCount === 1`), and spoof probability (<= 0.40).
    - Protected feature processing: non-invertible salted HMAC template comparison; zero raw images stored.
  - Anti-Brute Force Rate Limiting & Account Security:
    - Progressive lockout: 5 consecutive failed attempts trigger a 15-minute lockout (`lockedOut: true`, countdown timer).
    - Immediate block of all subsequent authentication attempts during active lockout, even with valid biometric data.
    - Step-up password recovery (`unlockWithStepUp` & `/api/auth/biometrics/unlock`): supervisor/user password input clears biometric lockout and resets failure counters.
    - Account enumeration prevention: uniform error responses avoiding disclosure of registered accounts or database details.
  - Authoritative Session Creation & Role Redirection:
    - Successful authentication (Password, Fingerprint, or Face) converges on canonical `UserSession` object with `sessionToken`, `sessionExpiresAt`, and explicit `authMethod`.
    - Role-specific dashboard routing:
      - `ADMIN` -> `ADMIN_DASHBOARD`
      - `MAKER` -> `MAKER_WORKSPACE`
      - `CHECKER` -> `CHECKER_INBOX`
      - `AUDITOR` -> `AUDITOR_DASHBOARD`
  - Automated Phase 12 Test Suite (`src/tests/phase12-biometric-signin-authentication.test.ts`):
    - 6 comprehensive test suites covering explicit method selection, WebAuthn fingerprint assertion and anti-replay safeguards, optical Face ID quality/liveness and server template matching, anti-brute force rate limiting and step-up password recovery, direct API bypass defenses, and password login regression across all four banking roles.
    - 100% pass across all 23 automated test suites in `run-all-tests.ts`.

## [11.0.0-phase11-biometric-registration-enrollment] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- **Genuine End-to-End Biometric Registration and Enrollment (`src/services/biometricService.ts`, `src/hooks/useBiometricAuth.ts`, `src/components/BiometricPromptModal.tsx`, `src/components/RegisterPage.tsx`, `src/tests/phase11-biometric-registration-enrollment.test.ts`, `11_BIOMETRIC_REGISTRATION_ENROLLMENT.md`)**:
  - Complete authenticated Face ID and Fingerprint/WebAuthn enrollment with genuine end-to-end flows and zero simulated success.
  - Independent Biometric Methods:
    - User selects one method at a time; enrolling Fingerprint leaves Face ID independent, and enrolling Face ID leaves Fingerprint independent.
    - Both methods can coexist on a single institutional account with distinct credential records and lifecycle states.
    - Post-registration success screen allows users to independently enroll a second method or proceed with standard credentials.
  - Optical Face ID Enrollment Pipeline:
    - Supports both live camera stream (PC/webcam) and native mobile selfie camera (`input type="file" capture="user"`).
    - Detects browser camera capabilities (`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`).
    - Staged accessible animation pipeline: `preparing`, `permission`, `camera start`, `face search`, `quality`, `liveness`, `processing`, and `success/failure/retry`.
    - Live optical frame preview with alignment guide reticle and oval guide.
    - Real-time client-side frame quality analysis (`analyzeFaceQuality`): luminance, sharpness (spatial Laplacian edge variance), single face presence, and face bounding ratio.
    - Real optical motion and liveness anti-spoofing analysis (`analyzeFaceLiveness`): temporal variance detection to prevent presentation attacks using static photos or simulated screens.
    - Server-authoritative quality and liveness enforcement (`/api/auth/biometrics/face/enroll`): validates single face, luminance in [35, 235], sharpness >= 0.35, spoof probability <= 0.40.
    - Protected template persistence: non-invertible salted HMAC feature signature (`computeProtectedFaceSignature`); zero raw camera frames or pixel buffers stored.
    - Graceful error notifications and recovery actions for: permission granted/denied/dismissed, no camera (`NotFoundError`), camera busy (`NotReadableError`), unsupported browser, initialization failure, no face (`faceCount === 0`), multiple faces (`faceCount > 1`), poor quality (blurry, underexposed, overexposed glare), timeout (30-second inactivity auto-cancel), liveness failure, and server failure.
    - Truthful hardware identity: does not claim exact device model unless the browser reliably provides it via `MediaDeviceInfo.label`.
  - WebAuthn Platform Fingerprint Passkey Enrollment:
    - Authenticated identity context binding: only active authorized institutional accounts can obtain challenges and register passkeys.
    - Cryptographic server challenge issuance (`/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/register-options`) with 60-second TTL.
    - Standard `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` with `platform` authenticator attachment and `userVerification: required`.
    - Server verification endpoint (`/api/auth/biometrics/webauthn/register-verify`) with credential ID storage, monotonic counter initialization, and public-key metadata.
    - Comprehensive error handling without simulated success: unsupported browser, unavailable platform authenticator, user cancellation (`AbortError`), timeout, iframe security policy restriction (`SecurityError`), and server verification failure.
  - Cross-Account Isolation & Identity Safeguards:
    - Prevents duplicate WebAuthn credential IDs across accounts (cross-account collision rejected with `BIOMETRIC_ENROLL_REJECTED` audit log).

## [8.0.0-phase8-configuration-governance-versioning-rollback] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Configuration Governance & Versioning Engine (`src/services/configurationGovernanceService.ts`, `08_CONFIGURATION_GOVERNANCE_VERSIONING_ROLLBACK.md`)**:
  - Full controlled lifecycle: `Draft → Validate → Impact Analysis → Dual Review/Approval → Publish → Effective → Audit`.
  - Four-tier risk classification engine:
    - `CRITICAL`: Role permissions, RBAC authorization, statutory return deletion.
    - `HIGH`: Mathematical formula alteration, field deletion, department restructuring, workflow alteration, and rollbacks.
    - `MEDIUM`: Description updates, optional field additions, non-critical assignments.
    - `LOW`: Cosmetic notes, display order adjustments. Auto-approval permitted.
  - Multi-domain impact analysis identifying affected:
    - Users (by report duty, department membership, and compliance supervisory responsibilities).
    - Departments (primary owners and contributing linked departments).
    - Reports (return keys, frequencies, formulas, and dependent schedules).
    - Workflows (submission review steps and role requirements).
    - Permissions (modified roles and authorization matrix).
    - Active and historical submissions (drafts, pending review, approved, sent), with explicit non-repudiation guarantees.
  - Credential and secret sanitization (`sanitizeGovernanceState`): Deep recursive scrubbing of passwords, tokens, API keys, hashes, and PINs to `[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]` in all before/after states.
  - Segregation of duties & 4-eyes rule enforcement:
    - Strict prohibition: Proposer cannot approve their own high-impact configuration proposal (`SEGREGATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION`).
    - Review restricted strictly to authorized `ADMIN` or `CHECKER` roles (`UNAUTHORIZED_APPROVAL`).
  - Optimistic concurrency locking & collision prevention:
    - Automatic version tracking (`expectedEntityVersion` and config hash) prevents administrators from silently overwriting each other's changes (`CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT`, HTTP 409).
  - Controlled governed rollback:
    - A rollback is a new auditable change; past versions and historical submissions are NEVER rewritten or lost.
    - Rollback creates a new version snapshot (Version N+1) reproducing the target historical schema.
  - Material change user notifications:
    - Users affected by material configuration changes receive targeted notifications detailing risk level, effective date, and impact rationale.
  - Phase 8 Completion Gate: Official audit explanation engine (`explainChange`):
    - Explains who changed what, when, from what, to what, under which approval/workflow, when it became effective, and what it affected.
- **Native ConfigService Rollback Integration (`src/services/configService.ts`)**:
  - `rollbackReportVersion(returnKey, targetVersionNumber, actor, reason)` safely recreates target schema as Version N+1 with permanent audit recording.
- **Frontend Governance Component (`src/components/ConfigurationGovernanceView.tsx`)**:
  - Rich split-pane workspace with proposal search, multi-level filters, 7-step visual lifecycle stepper, dependency impact cards, sanitized before/after diff table, 4-eyes review approval modal, rejection dialog, rollback modal with version picker, and the official "Explain Change" inspection modal.
  - Embedded into `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` under the **Governance & Versioning** tab.
  - Embedded into `src/components/ChangeHistoryView.tsx` with a top view-mode selector (**Governed Proposals & Approvals**).
- **Server REST API Endpoints (`server.ts`)**:
  - `/api/governance/proposals` (GET, POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id` (GET)

  - `/api/governance/proposals/rollback` (POST)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/explain` (GET)
  - `/api/governance/notifications` (GET)
  - `/api/governance/notifications/:id/read` (POST)
- **Comprehensive Automated Test Suite (`src/tests/configuration-governance-versioning.test.ts`)**:
  - 11 test sections (57 assertions, 100% pass) verifying secret sanitization, risk classification, impact analysis, structural validation, segregation of duties, optimistic concurrency collisions, publication, rejection, rollback, and the official audit explanation completion gate.

### Added
- **Authoritative Real-Time SSOT Engine (`src/services/realtimeSsotEngine.ts`, `server.ts`, `07_REAL_TIME_SSOT_SYNCHRONIZATION.md`)**:
  - WebSocket (`/ws/ssot`) + SSE (`/api/config/events`) real-time communication pipeline strictly anchored to Django/database SSOT authority.
  - Zero simulated timers or synthetic pollers; state changes propagate purely on committed transactional mutations.
  - Monotonic event sequence counter (`sequenceNumber`) and UUID generation (`eventId`) with 1,000-event circular replay buffer.
  - Comprehensive event taxonomy: `USER_CHANGED`, `DEPARTMENT_CHANGED`, `REPORT_CHANGED`, `ASSIGNMENT_CHANGED`, `SPECIAL_ACCESS_CHANGED`, `WORKFLOW_STATUS_CHANGED`, `CONFIG_SYNC_TRIGGER`.
  - Sensitive credential scrubbing: Automatic removal of `password`, `passwordHash`, `token`, and auth headers from event payloads.
  - Fine-grained topic subscription authorization (RBAC):
    - `ADMIN:CONFIG` & `ADMIN:USERS`: Strict Admin-only access.
    - `USER:<id>`: Strict individual officer isolation.
    - `DEPT:<id>`: Department members and authorized multi-department delegates.
    - `AUDIT:EVENTS`: Auditor and Admin inspection feed.
    - `GLOBAL` & `REPORTS`: Authenticated bank officer broad catalog updates.
- **Client Synchronization Service (`src/services/realtimeSsotClient.ts`)**:
  - Dual WebSocket + SSE failover transport.
  - Connection lifecycle management: Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (`1s` to `30s`) and random jitter, heartbeat keep-alive (`30s`), and connection state broadcasting.

## [6.0.0-phase6-safe-bulk-operations-import-export-and-file-workflows] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Authoritative Bulk Operations Engine (`src/services/bulkOperationsEngine.ts`, `06_BULK_OPERATIONS_IMPORT_EXPORT.md`)**:
  - Full transactional, auditable bulk management engine across Users, Departments, Reports, Submissions, and Special Access Grants.
  - **Mandatory Workflow**: `Select/upload → parse → validate → detect conflicts → preview → explicit confirmation → transactional execution → audit → result report`.
  - **Zero-Mutation Dry-Run Guarantee**: File uploads and parsing generate structured preview dry runs (`dryRunId`) with 15-minute TTL without mutating any underlying database or state.
  - **Conflict Strategies**: Configurable resolution modes: `UPDATE` (merge/update existing), `SKIP` (preserve existing, create new only), and `FAIL_ON_CONFLICT` (strictly reject batches containing duplicate identifiers).
  - **Deep Data Validation**: Required column checks, type validations, RFC 5322 email formatting, unique employee IDs and department short codes, valid organizational units, and batch-level duplicate detection.
  - **Atomic Transaction & Snapshot Rollback**: Pre-execution snapshots captured prior to mutations. If any row encounters an error in `ATOMIC` mode, the entire batch automatically reverts to the pristine snapshot and seals a `BULK_OPERATION_ROLLBACK` event in the audit trail.
  - **Partial Success Mode**: `PARTIAL` mode applies valid rows while recording exact row-level failures with actionable remediation notes.
  - **Formula Injection (CSV Injection / CWE-1236) Protection**: Neutralizes dynamic formula/DDE execution payloads starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r` by automatically prefixing single quotes on exports and parsed inputs.
  - **Oversized & Malicious File Protection**: Hard 5,000 row limits, payload sanitization, path traversal defense, and format enforcement (`CSV`, `JSON`, `XLSX`).
  - **Zero-Bypass Authorization & Privilege Escalation Checks**: Non-admins (Makers, Checkers, Auditors) are strictly barred from performing user/department bulk administration (`HTTP 403`). Protection prevents unauthorized promotion to `ADMIN` and prevents demotion or deactivation of the primary compliance administrator (`usr_admin_1`).
  - **Authorized Exports with Immutable Auditing**: Role- and department-filtered exports for Users, Departments, Reports, and Submissions in CSV, JSON, and XLSX formats with comprehensive audit logging.
- **Enterprise Bulk Operations Modal (`src/components/BulkOperationsModal.tsx`)**:
  - 4-step wizard interface: (1) Configure & Upload, (2) Validate & Preview with metric cards and paginated row-diff inspection, (3) Explicit Confirmation with legal/regulatory checkbox, and (4) Transactional Execution with full outcome breakdown.
- **Admin Dashboard Integration (`src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`)**:
  - Multi-select row checkboxes with "Select All Visible" header checkbox.
  - Floating Bulk Action Ribbon when users are selected: Activate, Deactivate (preserving historical reporting links), Reassign Department dialog, Assign Role dialog, Export Selected, and Clear Selection.
  - Top action toolbar button: "Bulk Import & Ops" and direct export buttons.
- **Department & Report Studio Integration (`src/components/DepartmentReportManagement.tsx`)**:
  - Upgraded Bulk Import to the transactional `BulkOperationsModal`.
- **Server REST API Endpoints (`server.ts`)**:
  - `POST /api/bulk/dry-run`: Dry-run validation preview.
  - `GET /api/bulk/dry-run/:dryRunId`: Retrieve cached dry-run with custom pagination.
  - `POST /api/bulk/execute`: Explicit transactional execution with mode and confirmation.
  - `POST /api/bulk/users/action`: Multi-select user actions (activate, deactivate, department, role, report assignment, special access).
  - `POST /api/bulk/reports/action`: Bulk report actions (retirement, activation, department linkage).
  - `POST /api/bulk/export`: Authorized and audited CSV/JSON/XLSX export.
- **Comprehensive Automated Test Suite (`src/tests/phase6-bulk-operations.test.ts`)**:
  - 12-section test coverage: formula injection, zero-mutation dry-run, explicit confirmation, conflict strategies (UPDATE, SKIP, FAIL), invalid data rejection, privilege escalation and root admin protection, atomic transaction rollback to pristine state, partial success mode, bulk multi-select user operations, report retirement preservation, authorized exports, and large dataset pagination (100% pass).
